Core Information
Field
	Details
	Disease Name
	Web Blight
	Scientific Name
	Rhizoctonia solani
	Category
	Fungal Disease
	Severity Index
	4/5 (High Economic Impact)
	Seasonal Patterns
	Peak infection during Kharif (Monsoon) and early Rabi (Winter) seasons, especially in fields with excessive moisture.
	Environmental Factors
	Prefers warm temperatures (25-30°C), high humidity (80-100%), and spreads rapidly in crowded plantings with excessive vegetative growth.
	Region
	Andhra Pradesh, Telangana
	Region-Specific Info
	Andhra Pradesh: High occurrences in Krishna, Guntur, East Godavari. Telangana: Frequently reported in Warangal, Karimnagar, Nizamabad, especially in waterlogged or poorly drained fields.
	Symptoms & Visual Indicators
Early Stage (Initial Infection)
* Symptoms: Small, water-soaked spots on lower leaves and stems that enlarge over time.
* Visual Indicator: Circular, grayish-green patches with moist edges on leaves.
Mid-Stage (Fungal Spread)
* Symptoms: Formation of white fungal web-like growth between stems and leaves.
* Visual Indicator: Thin fungal strands (mycelium) spreading across leaves and stems, forming web-like structures.
Advanced Stage (Severe Infection)
* Symptoms: Complete leaf drying, stem rot, and rapid plant wilting, leading to 50-70% yield loss.
* Visual Indicator: Leaves appear burned with large brown necrotic patches; plants collapse due to stem rot.
Prevention & Control
Cultural Practices
1. Avoid Dense Planting: Maintain proper spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity.
2. Ensure Proper Drainage: Avoid excessive irrigation and water stagnation.
3. Crop Rotation: Rotate with non-host crops like cereals (Maize, Sorghum) to reduce fungal buildup.
4. Remove Infected Debris: Burn or bury infected plant debris to prevent fungal survival.
Biological Controls
1. Seed Treatment with Trichoderma viride (5g/kg seeds): Prevents fungal infection at germination.
2. Foliar Spray of Pseudomonas fluorescens (2%): Inhibits Rhizoctonia solani growth.
3. Neem Cake Application (250 kg/ha): Suppresses fungal spores in the soil.
Chemical Controls
⚠️ Apply fungicides only when infection exceeds 10-15% of the field.

	What is Web Blight in Black Gram?
	Web Blight (Rhizoctonia solani) is a fungal disease that forms web-like fungal growth on leaves, leading to leaf drying and plant collapse.
	How does Web Blight spread?
	It spreads through contaminated soil, water splashes, and excessive moisture.
	Can Web Blight affect other crops?
	Yes, it also infects Soybean, Green Gram, and Pigeon Pea.
	Does Web Blight survive in soil?
	Yes, it remains in infected crop residues and soil for years as sclerotia.
	What are the symptoms of Web Blight?
	Symptoms include water-soaked lesions, white fungal webbing on stems and leaves, and rapid plant wilting.
	How do I identify Web Blight early?
	Look for small grayish water-soaked patches on lower leaves and stems.
	Can bacterial diseases cause similar symptoms?
	No, bacterial infections cause slimy wet rotting; Web Blight shows dry fungal webbing.
	What happens if Web Blight is left untreated?
	It leads to 50-70% yield loss due to rapid leaf and stem decay.
	When does Web Blight occur?
	It is most common in monsoon and early winter seasons under high humidity conditions (80-100%).
	Does rain affect Web Blight spread?
	Yes, continuous wet conditions encourage fungal growth and spread through splashing water.
	Can high temperatures reduce Web Blight infection?
	No, it thrives in warm conditions (25-30°C), especially in moist fields.
	Which months are most at risk for Web Blight?
	July-October during monsoon is the peak infection period for this disease.
	2️⃣ Scenario-Based Queries
Scenario Query
	Response
	What diseases affect Black Gram during high humidity?
	Major diseases include Web Blight, Cercospora Leaf Spot, and Yellow Mosaic Virus (YMV).
	How to manage Web Blight organically?
	Use Neem oil sprays, Trichoderma seed treatment, avoid dense planting, and ensure proper drainage.
	Which environmental conditions favor Web Blight spread?
	High humidity (80-100%) combined with moderate temperatures (25-30°C) increases infection risk significantly.
	What are early warning signs of Web Blight?
	Tiny water-soaked patches on lower leaves and white fungal webbing on stems indicate early infection stages.
	Can deep ploughing reduce Web Blight infection?
	Yes, deep ploughing exposes soil fungi to sunlight which reduces their viability significantly.
	3️⃣ Visual Indicator Queries
Query
	Response
	What does Web Blight look like in Black Gram?
	The disease appears as grayish water-soaked spots that develop white fungal webbing on leaves and stems under humid conditions.
	How do I identify Web Blight early?
	Look for thin white fungal strands spreading on the lower leaves and stems during moist conditions.
	Why are my Black Gram leaves turning brown and falling off?
	This is likely due to Web Blight; the fungus rapidly kills leaves by spreading necrotic lesions under high humidity conditions.
