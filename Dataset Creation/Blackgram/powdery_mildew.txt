	Details
	Disease Name
	Powdery Mildew
	Scientific Name
	Erysiphe polygoni
	Category
	Fungal Disease
	Severity Index
	3/5 (Moderate Economic Impact)
	Seasonal Patterns
	Peak infection during late Rabi (Winter) and early summer seasons, especially under dry conditions.
	Environmental Factors
	Prefers cool temperatures (15-25°C), high humidity (70-90%), and spreads rapidly under dry weather with moderate dew formation.
	Region
	Andhra Pradesh, Telangana
	Region-Specific Info
	Andhra Pradesh: High occurrences in Krishna, Guntur, Prakasam. Telangana: Frequently reported in Warangal, Nizamabad, Karimnagar, especially in areas with dense crop planting.
	Symptoms & Visual Indicators
Early Stage (Initial Infection)
* Symptoms: White powdery fungal patches on the upper surface of leaves.
* Visual Indicator: Fine, white dusty spots appearing on young leaves and stems.
Mid-Stage (Fungal Spread)
* Symptoms: Fungal patches expand, covering the entire leaf surface and reducing photosynthesis.
* Visual Indicator: Dense, white powdery growth on leaves, petioles, and young pods.
Advanced Stage (Severe Infection)
* Symptoms: Leaves turn yellow, curl, and dry out, leading to yield loss (30-50%).
* Visual Indicator: Leaves appear completely covered with white fungal growth, followed by drying and falling off.
Prevention & Control
Cultural Practices
1. Use Disease-Resistant Varieties: Resistant varieties like LBG-17 have shown high resistance to Powdery Mildew12.
2. Avoid Excessive Nitrogen Fertilization: High nitrogen levels promote fungal growth.
3. Ensure Proper Spacing: Avoid dense planting to increase air circulation and reduce humidity.
4. Timely Sowing: Avoid late sowing to escape peak disease periods2.
Biological Controls
1. Spray Trichoderma viride (5g/L water): Suppresses fungal spores effectively1.
2. Apply Neem Oil Extracts (2%): Reduces fungal spread naturally2.
3. Encourage Natural Antagonistic Fungi like Bacillus subtilis: Provides biological suppression of fungal growth1.
Chemical Controls
⚠️ Apply fungicides only when infection exceeds 10-15% of the field.

	What is Powdery Mildew in Black Gram?
	Powdery Mildew (Erysiphe polygoni) is a fungal disease that forms white powdery patches on leaves and stems, reducing crop yield.
	How does Powdery Mildew spread?
	It spreads through airborne spores and survives on crop residues.
	Can Powdery Mildew affect other crops?
	Yes, it also infects Pigeon Pea, Green Gram, and Chickpea.
	Does the fungus survive in soil?
	No, it mainly survives on infected plant debris and weed hosts.
	What are the symptoms of Powdery Mildew?
	Symptoms include white powdery fungal patches on leaves, petioles, and young pods, leading to leaf yellowing and drying.
	How do I identify Powdery Mildew early?
	Look for tiny white powdery spots on young leaves and stems.
	Can bacterial diseases cause similar symptoms?
	No, bacterial diseases cause water-soaked lesions rather than powdery patches.
	What happens if Powdery Mildew is left untreated?
	Severe infections cause 30-50% yield loss due to poor pod development and defoliation.
	When does Powdery Mildew occur?
	It is most common in late winter and early summer under dry conditions with moderate dew formation.
	Does rain reduce Powdery Mildew infection?
	Yes, high rainfall washes off fungal spores, slowing their spread.
	Can hot weather stop Powdery Mildew?
	No, dry and cool conditions (15-25°C) favor its growth.
	Which months are most at risk for Powdery Mildew?
	January-March during Rabi season is the peak infection period for this disease.
	2️⃣ Scenario-Based Queries
Scenario Query
	Response
	What diseases affect Black Gram during winter?
	Major diseases include Powdery Mildew, Rust, and Bacterial Leaf Blight.
	How to manage Powdery Mildew organically?
	Use Neem oil sprays, Trichoderma treatments, and reduce excessive nitrogen application.
	Which environmental conditions favor Powdery Mildew?
	Dry weather (15-25°C) with moderate humidity (70-90%) increases infection risk significantly.
	What are early warning signs of Powdery Mildew?
	Fine white powdery spots on young leaves and stems indicate early infection stages.
	Can mulching reduce Powdery Mildew infection?
	No, mulching increases humidity which can worsen the disease under favorable conditions.
	3️⃣ Visual Indicator Queries
Query
	Response
	What does Powdery Mildew look like?
	The disease appears as white powdery patches on leaves, stems, and pods under dry conditions3.
	How do I identify Powdery Mildew early?
	Look for fine white powder on young leaves and petioles in cool, dry conditions4.
	Why are my Black Gram leaves covered in white dust?
	This is likely due to Powdery Mildew infection where fungal spores spread rapidly in dry weather with moderate dew formation5.
