	Details
	Disease Name
	Alternaria Leaf Spot
	Scientific Name
	Alternaria alternata
	Category
	Fungal Disease
	Severity Index
	3/5 (Moderate Economic Impact)
	Seasonal Patterns
	Peak infection during Kharif (Monsoon) and early Rabi (Winter) seasons, especially in humid conditions.
	Environmental Factors
	Prefers moderate temperatures (20-30°C), high humidity (75-90%), and spreads rapidly through wind-borne spores.
	Region
	Andhra Pradesh, Telangana
	Region-Specific Info
	Andhra Pradesh: High occurrences in Krishna, Guntur, Prakasam. Telangana: Frequently reported in Warangal, Nizamabad, Karimnagar, especially in fields with continuous Black Gram cultivation.
	Symptoms & Visual Indicators
Early Stage (Initial Infection)
* Symptoms: Small, circular, brownish-black spots on older leaves.
* Visual Indicator: Tiny dark-brown lesions with concentric rings appearing on lower leaves.
Mid-Stage (Lesion Expansion)
* Symptoms: Lesions enlarge, coalesce, and cause premature leaf yellowing.
* Visual Indicator: Dark brown to black circular spots with a yellow halo, giving a "target board" appearance.
Advanced Stage (Severe Infection)
* Symptoms: Severe leaf blighting, premature defoliation, reduced photosynthesis, and poor pod development.
* Visual Indicator: Leaves dry up completely, turn brittle, and fall off, reducing overall yield.
Prevention & Control
Cultural Practices
1. Use Disease-Free Seeds: Avoid planting seeds from infected crops to prevent initial inoculum.
2. Crop Rotation: Rotate with non-host crops like cereals (Maize, Sorghum) to reduce fungal buildup.
3. Avoid Overhead Irrigation: Excess moisture on leaves promotes fungal spread.
Biological Controls
1. Seed Treatment with Trichoderma viride (5g/kg seeds): Suppresses fungal growth during germination.
2. Foliar Spray of Bacillus subtilis (2%): Prevents Alternaria infections effectively.
3. Neem Cake Application (250 kg/ha): Reduces fungal spore load in the soil.

	What is Alternaria Leaf Spot in Black Gram?
	Alternaria Leaf Spot (Alternaria alternata) is a fungal disease that causes circular brown spots on leaves, leading to defoliation and reduced yield.
	How does Alternaria Leaf Spot spread?
	It spreads through wind-borne spores, infected seeds, and plant residues.
	Can Alternaria Leaf Spot affect other crops?
	Yes, it also infects Pigeon Pea, Green Gram, and Chickpea.
	Does Alternaria remain in soil?
	Yes, it survives in infected plant debris and spreads through spores.
	What are the symptoms of Alternaria Leaf Spot?
	Symptoms include brown circular spots with yellow halos on leaves, premature leaf drop, and reduced photosynthesis.
	How do I identify Alternaria Leaf Spot early?
	Look for small brownish-black spots with concentric rings on lower leaves.
	Can bacterial or viral infections cause similar symptoms?
	No, bacterial diseases cause wet lesions; viral diseases cause leaf crinkling; fungal spots are distinct.
	What happens if Alternaria Leaf Spot is left untreated?
	It leads to 30-50% yield loss due to severe defoliation and poor pod formation.
	When does Alternaria Leaf Spot occur?
	It is most common in monsoon and early winter seasons under high humidity conditions (75-90%).
	Does rain affect Alternaria spread?
	Yes, continuous wet conditions promote spore germination and leaf infection.
	Can hot weather reduce Alternaria infection?
	No, it thrives in warm conditions (20-30°C), especially with high humidity levels.
	Which months are most at risk for Alternaria Leaf Spot?
	July-October during monsoon is the peak infection period for this disease.
	2️⃣ Scenario-Based Queries
Scenario Query
	Response
	What diseases affect Black Gram during high humidity?
	Major diseases include Alternaria Leaf Spot, Cercospora Leaf Spot, and Web Blight under humid conditions.
	How to manage Alternaria Leaf Spot organically?
	Use Neem oil sprays to suppress fungal spread; apply Trichoderma seed treatment; improve soil drainage practices.
	Which environmental conditions favor Alternaria spread?
	High humidity (75-90%) combined with moderate temperatures (20-30°C) increases infection risk significantly.
	What are early warning signs of Alternaria Leaf Spot?
	Tiny brown circular spots with yellow halos on older leaves indicate early infection stages caused by wind-borne spores.
	Can deep ploughing reduce Alternaria infection?
	Yes, deep ploughing exposes soil fungi to sunlight which reduces their viability significantly.
	3️⃣ Visual Indicator Queries
Query
	Response
	What does Alternaria Leaf Spot look like in Black Gram?
	The disease appears as brown circular spots with yellow halos resembling a target board under humid conditions.
	How do I identify Alternaria Leaf Spot early?
	Look for tiny brown lesions with concentric rings on the lower leaves during early stages of infection.
	Why are my Black Gram leaves turning yellow and falling off?
	This is likely due to Alternaria Leaf Spot causing severe leaf blighting and premature defoliation under favorable conditions.
