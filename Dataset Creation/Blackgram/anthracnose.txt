Core Information
Field
	Details
	Disease Name
	Anthracnose
	Scientific Name
	Colletotrichum truncatum
	Category
	Fungal Disease
	Severity Index
	4/5 (High Economic Impact)
	Seasonal Patterns
	Peak infection during Kharif (Monsoon) and late Rabi (Winter) seasons, especially in humid conditions.
	Environmental Factors
	Prefers moderate temperatures (20-30°C), high humidity (80-90%), and spreads rapidly in wet conditions or after heavy rainfall.
	Region
	Andhra Pradesh, Telangana
	Region-Specific Info
	Andhra Pradesh: High occurrences in Krishna, Guntur, Nellore. Telangana: Frequently reported in Warangal, Nizamabad, Karimnagar, especially in fields with poor drainage.
	Symptoms & Visual Indicators
Early Stage (Initial Infection)
* Symptoms: Small, sunken, circular brown spots on leaves, stems, and pods.
* Visual Indicator: Tiny reddish-brown lesions appearing mainly on older leaves and stems.
Mid-Stage (Lesion Expansion)
* Symptoms: Lesions expand, turn dark brown to black, and coalesce, leading to blighting.
* Visual Indicator: Dark sunken spots on stems and pods with concentric ring patterns.
Advanced Stage (Severe Infection)
* Symptoms: Leaves curl, dry, and fall off; pods become deformed and shriveled, leading to 40-50% yield loss.
* Visual Indicator: Severe defoliation with black irregular spots on all plant parts. Under humid conditions, pinkish fungal spore masses appear on lesions.
Prevention & Control
Cultural Practices
1. Use Disease-Free Seeds: Anthracnose is seed-borne; always use treated seeds.
2. Avoid Water Logging: Ensure proper field drainage to reduce fungal spread.
3. Crop Rotation: Avoid planting Black Gram in the same field every season.
4. Sanitation Practices: Remove infected crop residues to reduce fungal spore survival.
Biological Controls
1. Spray Trichoderma viride (5g/L water): Suppresses fungal spores.
2. Apply Neem Oil Extracts (2%): Slows fungal growth naturally.
3. Encourage Natural Antagonistic Fungi like Bacillus subtilis: Prevents fungal spread.
Chemical Controls
⚠️ Apply fungicides only when infection exceeds 10-15% of the field.

	What is Anthracnose in Black Gram?
	Anthracnose (Colletotrichum truncatum) is a fungal disease causing leaf blight, pod deformation, and yield loss in Black Gram.
	How does Anthracnose spread?
	It spreads through infected seeds, rain splashes, and high humidity.
	Can Anthracnose affect other crops?
	Yes, it also infects Green Gram, Soybean, and Cowpea.
	Does the fungus survive in soil?
	Yes, it can persist in infected crop residues and contaminated seeds for several seasons.
	What are the symptoms of Anthracnose?
	Symptoms include sunken brown lesions on leaves, stems, and pods leading to blighting.
	How do I identify Anthracnose early?
	Look for tiny reddish-brown spots on older leaves and stems.
	Can bacterial diseases cause similar symptoms?
	Yes, Bacterial Leaf Blight also causes leaf spots but bacterial infections produce yellow halos instead of concentric rings.
	What happens if Anthracnose is left untreated?
	Severe infections can cause 40-50% yield loss due to pod deformation and leaf drop.
	When does Anthracnose occur?
	It is most common in monsoon and early winter seasons under humid conditions (80-90% RH).
	Does rain increase Anthracnose?
	Yes, prolonged leaf wetness and splashing water spread spores rapidly.
	Can dry weather stop Anthracnose?
	Yes, the disease slows down in hot, dry conditions but remains dormant until favorable conditions return.
	Which months are most at risk for Anthracnose?
	July-October during monsoon is the peak infection period for this disease.
	2️⃣ Scenario-Based Queries
Scenario Query
	Response
	What diseases affect Black Gram during monsoon?
	Major diseases include Anthracnose, Cercospora Leaf Spot, and Yellow Mosaic Virus (YMV).
	How to manage Anthracnose organically?
	Use Neem oil sprays, Trichoderma treatments, and avoid water-logged fields.
	Which environmental conditions favor Anthracnose?
	High humidity (80-90%) and moderate temperatures (20-30°C) increase infection risk significantly.
	What are early warning signs of Anthracnose?
	Tiny reddish-brown spots on older leaves and sunken lesions on pods indicate early infection stages.
	Can mulching reduce Anthracnose infection?
	Yes, organic mulching reduces soil-to-leaf fungal transmission effectively.
	3️⃣ Visual Indicator Queries
Query
	Response
	What do Anthracnose lesions look like?
	The lesions are sunken dark brown with concentric ring patterns appearing on stems and pods under humid conditions.
	How do I identify Anthracnose early?
	Look for tiny reddish-brown spots on older leaves and sunken lesions on young pods during wet conditions.
	Why are my Black Gram pods shriveled and deformed?
	Likely due to Anthracnose weakening pod development and causing seed loss under high humidity conditions.
