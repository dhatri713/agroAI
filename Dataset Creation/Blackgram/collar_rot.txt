	Details
	Disease Name
	Collar Rot
	Scientific Name
	Sclerotium rolfsii
	Category
	Fungal Disease
	Severity Index
	4/5 (High Economic Impact)
	Seasonal Patterns
	Peak infection during Kharif (Monsoon) and early Rabi (Winter) seasons, especially in poorly drained fields.
	Environmental Factors
	Prefers high temperatures (25-35°C), high humidity (80-100%), and spreads rapidly in wet soil conditions.
	Region
	Andhra Pradesh, Telangana
	Region-Specific Info
	Andhra Pradesh: High occurrences in Krishna, Guntur, Prakasam. Telangana: Frequently reported in Warangal, Karimnagar, Nizamabad, especially in fields with poor drainage and excessive organic debris.
	Symptoms & Visual Indicators
Early Stage (Initial Infection)
* Symptoms: Water-soaked lesions form at the base of the stem (collar region).
* Visual Indicator: Small, circular, brownish spots at the stem base near the soil line.
Mid-Stage (Fungal Spread)
* Symptoms: Cottony white fungal growth appears at the base of the stem, leading to plant wilting.
* Visual Indicator: White fungal mycelium covering the collar region and surrounding soil.
Advanced Stage (Severe Infection)
* Symptoms: Roots rot, plants collapse, and hard, mustard-sized fungal sclerotia form at the base.
* Visual Indicator: Brown, dried-out stems with hard, white-to-brown fungal sclerotia near the base.
Prevention & Control
Cultural Practices
1. Use Disease-Free Seeds: Avoid using seeds from infected fields to prevent initial inoculum.
2. Improve Field Drainage: Ensure proper drainage to avoid standing water near the plant base.
3. Crop Rotation: Rotate with non-host crops like cereals (Maize, Sorghum) to reduce fungal buildup.
4. Remove Plant Debris: Burn or bury infected residues to limit fungal survival.
Biological Controls
1. Seed Treatment with Trichoderma viride (5g/kg seeds): Suppresses fungal growth during germination.
2. Soil Drenching with Pseudomonas fluorescens (2%): Inhibits Sclerotium rolfsii activity in soil.
3. Neem Cake Application (250 kg/ha): Reduces fungal spore load in the soil.
Chemical Controls
⚠️ Apply fungicides only when infection exceeds 10-15% of the field.

	What is Collar Rot in Black Gram?
	Collar Rot (Sclerotium rolfsii) is a fungal disease that attacks the base of the stem, causing plant wilting and death.
	How does Collar Rot spread?
	It spreads through contaminated soil, crop residues, and excessive moisture.
	Can Collar Rot affect other crops?
	Yes, it also infects Groundnut, Soybean, and Chickpea.
	Does Collar Rot survive in soil?
	Yes, it remains in infected soil and plant debris for years as sclerotia.
	What are the symptoms of Collar Rot?
	Symptoms include water-soaked lesions at the stem base, white fungal mycelium, and plant collapse.
	How do I identify Collar Rot early?
	Look for brown spots and a cottony white fungal layer at the base of seedlings.
	Can bacterial diseases cause similar symptoms?
	No, bacterial infections cause soft wet rotting; Collar Rot causes dry hardened decay.
	What happens if Collar Rot is left untreated?
	It leads to 50-70% yield loss due to complete plant collapse and root decay.
	When does Collar Rot occur?
	It is most common in monsoon and early winter seasons under high humidity conditions (80-100%).
	Does rain affect Collar Rot spread?
	Yes, continuous wet conditions encourage fungal growth and spread through splashing water.
	Can high temperatures reduce Collar Rot infection?
	No, it thrives in warm conditions (25-35°C), especially in moist fields.
	Which months are most at risk for Collar Rot?
	July-October during monsoon is the peak infection period for this disease.
	2️⃣ Scenario-Based Queries
Scenario Query
	Response
	What diseases affect Black Gram during high humidity?
	Major diseases include Collar Rot, Web Blight, and Root Rot under humid conditions.
	How to manage Collar Rot organically?
	Use Neem Cake application to soil, Trichoderma seed treatment, and improve field drainage practices.
	Which environmental conditions favor Collar Rot spread?
	High humidity (80-100%) combined with warm temperatures (25-35°C) increases infection risk significantly.
	What are early warning signs of Collar Rot?
	Tiny brown spots at the stem base near soil line and white fungal growth indicate early infection stages.
	Can deep ploughing reduce Collar Rot infection?
	Yes, deep ploughing exposes soil fungi to sunlight which reduces their viability significantly.
	3️⃣ Visual Indicator Queries
Query
	Response
	What does Collar Rot look like in Black Gram?
	The disease appears as brown spots at the stem base with white cottony fungal growth followed by plant wilting under humid conditions.
	How do I identify Collar Rot early?
	Look for water-soaked lesions at the soil line with cottony fungal strands spreading on the surface near the collar region of seedlings.
	Why are my Black Gram seedlings dying after germination?
	This is likely due to Collar Rot; it weakens the stem base causing plants to fall over and die rapidly under moist conditions.
