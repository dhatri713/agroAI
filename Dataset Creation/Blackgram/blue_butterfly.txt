Core Information
Field
	Details
	Pest Name
	Blue Butterfly (Pea Blue Butterfly)
	Scientific Name
	Lampides boeticus
	Category
	Pest (Pod Borer)
	Severity Index
	3/5 (Moderate Economic Impact)
	Seasonal Patterns
	Peak infestation during Kharif (Monsoon) and late Rabi (Winter) seasons, especially in humid conditions.
	Environmental Factors
	Prefers warm temperatures (22-30°C), moderate humidity (60-80%), and thrives during flowering and pod formation stages.
	Region
	Andhra Pradesh, Telangana
	Region-Specific Info
	Andhra Pradesh: Major infestations in Guntur, Krishna, Prakasam. Telangana: Frequent in Nizamabad, Warangal, Medak due to continuous Black Gram cultivation.
	Symptoms & Visual Indicators
Early Stage (Eggs & Neonate Larvae)
* Symptoms: Eggs laid on flower buds and young pods.
* Visual Indicator: Small round white eggs attached to flower buds.
Mid-Stage (Growing Larvae)
* Symptoms: Larvae bore into pods and eat developing seeds, causing pod deformation.
* Visual Indicator: Greenish caterpillars with a flattened body, hiding inside pods.
Advanced Stage (Severe Infestation)
* Symptoms: Empty pods, seed damage, and pod drop, leading to 30-40% yield loss.
* Visual Indicator: Damaged pods with exit holes where mature larvae have left.
Prevention & Control
Cultural Practices
1. Early Sowing (June-July): Avoids peak Blue Butterfly activity.
2. Intercropping with Mustard or Sorghum: Reduces larval survival rates.
3. Deep Ploughing Post-Harvest: Kills pupae in the soil, reducing future infestations.
4. Crop Sanitation: Remove weeds and crop residues to eliminate breeding grounds.
Biological Controls
1. Release of Trichogramma chilonis: Egg parasitoids that prevent hatching.
2. Neem-Based Sprays (Azadirachtin 1%): Reduces larval feeding.
3. Predatory Wasps (Telenomus spp.): Effective against larvae inside pods.
4. Biopesticides like Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt): Applied as a foliar spray to control larvae.
Chemical Controls
⚠️ Use only when infestation exceeds ETL (Economic Threshold Level = 2 larvae per meter row length).

	What is Blue Butterfly in Black Gram?
	The Blue Butterfly (Lampides boeticus), also called Pea Blue Butterfly, is a pod borer that damages Black Gram by feeding on developing seeds inside pods.
	How does the Blue Butterfly damage crops?
	The larvae bore into pods, eat the seeds, and cause pod drop.
	Can Blue Butterfly attack other crops?
	Yes, it also infests Pigeon Pea, Green Gram, and Chickpea.
	Are adult butterflies harmful to crops?
	No, only the larvae (caterpillars) damage the pods.
	What are the symptoms of infestation?
	Symptoms include small boreholes in pods, deformed pods, and premature pod drop.
	How do I identify larvae inside pods?
	Cut open an infested pod; you will see a small green caterpillar inside.
	Can fungal infections cause similar damage?
	No, fungal infections cause pod rot but do not create boreholes.
	What happens if infestation is not controlled?
	Yield loss can reach 30-40%, and damaged pods become unmarketable.
	When does Blue Butterfly attack crops?
	The highest risk is during flowering and pod formation stages in monsoon and winter seasons.
	Does high humidity increase infestation?
	Yes, humid weather during pod formation favors larval survival.
	Can late sowing increase pest population?
	Yes, late sowing exposes crops to peak butterfly activity.
	What weather conditions favor infestation?
	Moderate temperatures (22-30°C) with occasional rains promote infestation.
	2️⃣ Scenario-Based Queries
Scenario Query
	Response
	What pests attack Black Gram during flowering and pod formation?
	Major pests include Blue Butterfly, Gram Pod Borer, and Spotted Pod Borer.
	How to control Blue Butterfly infestation without using chemicals?
	Use Neem oil sprays, intercropping, and release of egg parasitoids like Trichogramma chilonis.
	Which crops should not be grown near Black Gram to prevent attacks?
	Avoid planting Pigeon Pea and Chickpea as they serve as alternate hosts for the pest.
	What are early warning signs of infestation?
	Small white eggs on flowers, green caterpillars inside pods, and premature pod drop are early signs.
	Can mulching reduce infestation?
	Yes, applying organic mulch discourages adult butterflies from laying eggs on plants.
	3️⃣ Visual Indicator Queries
Query
	Response
	What does the Blue Butterfly caterpillar look like?
	The larvae are small, greenish with a flattened body that hides inside pods while feeding on seeds.
	How do I identify Blue Butterfly eggs?
	Look for tiny white eggs laid singly on flower buds or young pods.
	Why are my Black Gram pods empty inside?
	Likely due to Blue Butterfly larvae boring into the pods and eating the seeds inside.
