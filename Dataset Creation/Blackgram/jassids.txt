Core Information
Field
	Details
	Pest Name
	Jassids (Leafhoppers)
	Scientific Name
	Amrasca biguttula biguttula
	Category
	Pest (Sap-Sucking Insect)
	Severity Index
	3/5 (Moderate Economic Impact)
	Seasonal Patterns
	Peak infestation during Kharif (Monsoon) and early Rabi (Winter) seasons, especially in humid conditions.
	Environmental Factors
	Prefers moderate temperatures (22-30°C), high humidity (60-80%), and thrives in overcrowded crops with high nitrogen content.
	Region
	Andhra Pradesh, Telangana
	Region-Specific Info
	Andhra Pradesh: Major infestations in Guntur, Krishna, Prakasam. Telangana: Frequent in Warangal, Nizamabad, Medak due to continuous Black Gram cultivation.
	Symptoms & Visual Indicators
Early Stage (Eggs & Nymphs)
* Symptoms: Eggs laid inside leaf veins; nymphs start feeding on leaf sap.
* Visual Indicator: Yellowish-green nymphs visible on the underside of leaves.
Mid-Stage (Heavy Feeding)
* Symptoms: Leaves turn yellow, edges curl upwards, and plants show stunted growth.
* Visual Indicator: Jumping green insects seen when plants are disturbed.
Advanced Stage (Severe Infestation)
* Symptoms: Leaves turn reddish-brown, dry, and drop prematurely, leading to yield loss (30-40%).
* Visual Indicator: Leaves appear scorched (“hopper burn”) and plants stop growing.
Prevention & Control
Cultural Practices
1. Avoid Overcrowding: Maintain proper spacing to reduce humidity buildup.
2. Intercropping with Mustard or Sorghum: Reduces Jassid infestation rates.
3. Timely Sowing (June-July): Avoids peak Jassid population.
4. Crop Sanitation: Regularly remove weeds and debris to reduce Jassid habitats.
Biological Controls
1. Release of Chrysoperla carnea (Green Lacewing): A natural predator of Jassids.
2. Use of Neem Oil Sprays (2% solution): Repels and controls Jassid populations.
3. Encouraging Spiders & Ladybird Beetles to feed on Jassids.
Chemical Controls
⚠️ Apply chemicals only when infestation exceeds ETL (Economic Threshold Level = 2-3 nymphs per leaf).

	What are Jassids?
	Jassids (Amrasca biguttula biguttula) are tiny sap-sucking insects that damage Black Gram by removing plant juices, causing leaf curling and yellowing.
	How do Jassids spread in the field?
	Jassids spread through flight and wind, rapidly infesting nearby crops.
	Can Jassids affect other crops?
	Yes, they also attack Cotton, Okra, and Brinjal.
	Are all Jassids harmful?
	No, some Jassid species are not pests, but Amrasca biguttula biguttula is a major agricultural threat.
	What are the symptoms of Jassid infestation?
	Symptoms include yellowing leaves, curling at the edges, and reddish-brown patches (“hopper burn”).
	How do I identify Jassids early?
	Look for small green insects on leaf undersides and upward curling leaf edges.
	What happens if Jassids are not controlled?
	Severe infestations can reduce yield by 30-40% and cause early defoliation.
	Can Jassids cause viral diseases?
	No, Jassids do not transmit viruses, but they weaken the plant, making it susceptible to infections.
	When do Jassids attack Black Gram?
	Jassids are most active in Kharif (Monsoon) and early Rabi (Winter) seasons, especially in humid conditions.
	Does high humidity favor Jassid infestation?
	Yes, high humidity and warm temperatures (22-30°C) encourage rapid multiplication.
	Can strong rains reduce Jassid populations?
	Yes, heavy rain can wash off Jassids, reducing infestation.
	Which month has the highest risk for Jassids?
	July-September sees the most Jassid outbreaks.
	2️⃣ Scenario-Based Queries
Scenario Query
	Response
	What pests attack Black Gram during monsoon?
	Major pests include Jassids, Whiteflies, and Aphids, which thrive in humid conditions.
	How to control Jassids organically?
	Use Neem oil sprays, intercropping with Mustard, and releasing Lacewing insects.
	Which plants attract more Jassids near Black Gram?
	Cotton, Okra, and Brinjal often attract Jassids, increasing risk.
	What are early warning signs of Jassid infestation?
	Leaves curling at the edges, yellowing, and tiny green insects on leaf undersides.
	Can mulching help reduce Jassid infestation?
	Yes, reflective plastic mulching discourages Jassid movement.
	3️⃣ Visual Indicator Queries
Query
	Response
	What do Jassids look like?
	Jassids are small green insects, often found on the undersides of leaves.
	How do I identify Jassid infestation early?
	Look for leaves curling upwards, yellow patches, and green insects jumping when plants are disturbed.
	Why are my Black Gram leaves turning reddish-brown?
	Likely due to Jassid infestation, which causes “hopper burn”.
