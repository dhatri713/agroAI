	Category
	Fungal Disease
	Severity Index
	4/5 (High Economic Impact)
	Seasonal Patterns
	Peak infection during Rabi (Winter) and summer seasons, especially in drought conditions.
	Environmental Factors
	Prefers high temperatures (30-35°C), low soil moisture, and spreads rapidly in sandy, poorly fertilized soils.
	Region
	Andhra Pradesh, Telangana
	Region-Specific Info
	Andhra Pradesh: High occurrences in Krishna, Guntur, Prakasam. Telangana: Frequently reported in Warangal, Nizamabad, Karimnagar, especially in drought-prone areas.
	Symptoms & Visual Indicators
Early Stage (Initial Infection)
* Symptoms: Wilting of lower leaves and yellowing of plants.
* Visual Indicator: Slight browning at the base of the stem and roots.
Mid-Stage (Fungal Spread)
* Symptoms: Drying of the plant, stem turning dark brown, and root decay.
* Visual Indicator: Black fungal threads (sclerotia) visible inside split stems and roots.
Advanced Stage (Severe Infection)
* Symptoms: Complete plant collapse, shriveled roots, and yield loss (50-70%).
* Visual Indicator: Plants easily pulled from the soil, with dry, rotten roots.
Prevention & Control
Cultural Practices
1. Use Disease-Resistant Varieties: Some Black Gram varieties show resistance.
2. Avoid Water Stress: Irrigate fields at critical growth stages to reduce plant stress.
3. Improve Soil Health: Incorporate organic matter like compost or farmyard manure to boost beneficial soil microbes.
4. Deep Ploughing Post-Harvest: Exposes fungal spores to sunlight, reducing their viability.
Biological Controls
1. Seed Treatment with Trichoderma viride (5g/kg seeds): Prevents fungal growth on seeds.
2. Soil Application of Pseudomonas fluorescens (2.5 kg/ha): Suppresses fungal activity in soil.
3. Neem Cake Application (250 kg/ha): Reduces fungal load in the soil.
Chemical Controls
⚠️ Apply fungicides only when infection exceeds 10-15% of the field.

	What is Root Rot in Black Gram?
	Root Rot (Macrophomina phaseolina) is a fungal disease causing root decay, plant wilting, and severe yield loss.
	How does Root Rot spread?
	It spreads through infected soil, seeds, and drought stress conditions.
	Can Root Rot affect other crops?
	Yes, it also infects Soybean, Chickpea, and Pigeon Pea.
	Does the fungus remain in soil?
	Yes, it persists in soil and crop residues for years as sclerotia.
	What are the symptoms of Root Rot?
	Symptoms include wilting, yellowing leaves, root decay, and black fungal threads inside stems.
	How do I identify Root Rot early?
	Look for slight browning at the stem base and drying of lower leaves.
	Can bacterial diseases cause similar symptoms?
	No, bacterial infections cause wet/slimy rotting; Macrophomina causes dry rot.
	What happens if Root Rot is left untreated?
	It leads to 50-70% yield loss due to complete plant collapse and root decay.
	When does Root Rot occur?
	It is most common in dry sandy soils during Rabi and summer seasons under drought stress.
	Does rain affect Root Rot spread?
	No, dry weather increases infection; however, excessive moisture can cause stem rot instead.
	Can irrigation reduce Root Rot?
	Yes, proper irrigation at critical growth stages reduces stress and prevents infection.
	Which months are most at risk for Root Rot?
	February-May during late Rabi and summer is the peak infection period for this disease.
	2️⃣ Scenario-Based Queries
Scenario Query
	Response
	What diseases affect Black Gram during dry weather?
	Major diseases include Root Rot, Wilt, and Charcoal Rot caused by similar fungi under drought stress conditions.
	How to manage Root Rot organically?
	Use Trichoderma seed treatment, Neem Cake application to soil, and organic mulching to improve moisture retention.
	Which environmental conditions favor Root Rot spread?
	High temperatures (30-35°C), low soil moisture levels, and sandy soils increase infection risk significantly.
	What are early warning signs of Root Rot?
	Browning of stem base near soil line, yellowing lower leaves, and dry roots indicate early stages of infection.
	Can deep ploughing reduce Root Rot infection?
	Yes, deep ploughing exposes fungal spores to sunlight which reduces their viability in the soil significantly.
	3️⃣ Visual Indicator Queries
Query
	Response
	What does Root Rot look like in Black Gram?
	The disease appears as dark brown shriveled roots with black fungal threads inside stems under severe infection conditions.
	How do I identify Root Rot early?
	Look for wilting lower leaves with slight browning at the stem base; roots may feel dry or weak when pulled from the soil.
	Why are my Black Gram plants drying up despite irrigation?
	This is likely due to Root Rot; the fungus blocks water uptake by destroying root tissues even if irrigation is adequate.
