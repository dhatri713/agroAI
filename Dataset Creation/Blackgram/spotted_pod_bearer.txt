Core Information
Field
	Details
	Pest Name
	Spotted Pod Borer
	Scientific Name
	Maruca vitrata (previously known as Maruca testulalis)
	Category
	Pest
	Severity Index
	3.5/5 (Moderate to High Economic Impact)
	Seasonal Patterns
	Peak infestation during Kharif (Monsoon) and Rabi (Winter) seasons, especially under humid conditions.
	Environmental Factors
	Prefers high humidity (75-85%), moderate temperatures (22-28°C), and is more active during cloudy, wet conditions.
	Region
	Andhra Pradesh, Telangana
	Region-Specific Info
	Andhra Pradesh: Major infestations in Krishna, East Godavari, Guntur. Telangana: Frequent in Nizamabad, Warangal, Khammam due to continuous Black Gram cultivation.
	Symptoms & Visual Indicators
Early Stage (Eggs & Neonate Larvae)
* Symptoms: Small, translucent yellow eggs on flower buds and leaves.
* Visual Indicator: Tiny white eggs in clusters near flowers.
Mid-Stage (Growing Larvae)
* Symptoms: Larvae bore into flowers and pods, causing premature pod drop.
* Visual Indicator: White larvae with dark spots seen feeding on flowers.
Advanced Stage (Severe Infestation)
* Symptoms: Silken webbing of flowers and pods, severe seed loss, and yield reduction.
* Visual Indicator: Webbed flowers and pods, hollowed pods with exit holes.
Prevention & Control
Cultural Practices
* Timely Sowing: Sow in June-July to reduce pest population exposure.
* Intercropping: Intercrop with Millets or Sorghum to disrupt pest cycles.
* Deep Ploughing: Perform deep ploughing post-harvest to eliminate larvae and pupae in soil.
Biological Controls
* Trichogramma chilonis: Release to parasitize Maruca vitrata eggs.
* Neem-based Sprays: Use Azadirachtin 1% to reduce larval feeding.
* Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt): Spray for natural control of larvae.
Chemical Controls
* Apply chemicals only when infestation exceeds ETL (2 larvae per meter row length).
* Pesticide Dosage and Mode of Action:
   * Spinosad 45 SC: 0.3 ml/L water, neurotoxic effect on larvae.
   * Emamectin Benzoate 5 SG: 0.5 g/L water, disrupts larval nervous system.
   * Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC: 0.3 ml/L water, highly effective on larvae.

	What is Spotted Pod Borer?
	Spotted Pod Borer (Maruca vitrata) is a major pest affecting Black Gram by feeding on flowers and pods, leading to yield loss.
	How does Spotted Pod Borer impact Black Gram yield?
	Severe infestations cause 30-50% yield loss due to webbed flowers and empty pods.
	Can Spotted Pod Borer attack other crops?
	Yes, it also infests Pigeon Pea, Cowpea, and Soybean.
	How is Spotted Pod Borer different from Gram Pod Borer?
	Spotted Pod Borer larvae are white with dark spots, while Gram Pod Borer larvae are greenish-brown.
	What are the symptoms of Spotted Pod Borer?
	Symptoms include silken webbing of flowers and pods, premature pod drop, and seed loss.
	How do I identify Spotted Pod Borer early?
	Look for webbing of flowers and small white larvae inside pods.
	Can other factors cause webbing on flowers?
	Yes, certain fungal infections and mites can also cause webbing.
	What is the best way to inspect my crop?
	Check flowers and pods in the morning, when larvae are most active.
	When does Spotted Pod Borer attack Black Gram?
	Infestation peaks in monsoon (Kharif) and winter (Rabi), especially during high humidity.
	Is infestation worse in wet conditions?
	Yes, cloudy and humid weather increases larval survival.
	Can extreme heat reduce Spotted Pod Borer populations?
	Yes, hot and dry conditions reduce egg hatching and larval survival.
	Which month has the highest risk of infestation?
	August-October is the peak period.
	2️⃣ Scenario-Based Queries
Scenario Query
	Response
	What pests affect Black Gram during Monsoon?
	Major pests include Spotted Pod Borer, Gram Pod Borer, Whiteflies, and Aphids.
	How to prevent pest outbreaks in organic Black Gram farming?
	Use Neem oil sprays, intercropping, and release of beneficial insects like Trichogramma.
	Which crops should not be grown near Black Gram?
	Avoid Cowpea and Pigeon Pea, as they are alternate hosts for Maruca vitrata.
	What are the early warning signs of Spotted Pod Borer?
	Webbed flowers, small white larvae inside pods, and sudden pod drop are key signs.
	Does late sowing increase pod borer infestation?
	Yes, late-sown crops are at higher risk as Maruca vitrata populations peak mid-season.
	3️⃣ Visual Indicator Queries
Query
	Response
	What does Spotted Pod Borer larvae look like?
	The larvae are white with dark spots, growing up to 2-3 cm.
	How do I identify Spotted Pod Borer at early stages?
	Look for tiny translucent yellow eggs on flower buds and leaves.
	Why are my Black Gram pods empty inside?
	This could be due to Spotted Pod Borer, as larvae bore into pods and eat the seeds.
