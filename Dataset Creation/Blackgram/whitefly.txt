	Details
	Pest Name
	Whitefly
	Scientific Name
	Bemisia tabaci
	Category
	Pest (Sap-Sucking Insect, Virus Vector)
	Severity Index
	4/5 (High Economic Impact)
	Seasonal Patterns
	Peak infestation during Kharif (Monsoon) and Rabi (Winter) seasons, especially in warm and dry conditions. However, Whiteflies can thrive in various environmental conditions, including hot and dry weather.
	Environmental Factors
	Prefers warm temperatures (25-35°C), dry weather, and thrives in drought-like conditions. Whiteflies are also influenced by factors like plant nutrition and crop density.
	Region
	Andhra Pradesh, Telangana
	Region-Specific Info
	Andhra Pradesh: Major outbreaks in Guntur, Nellore, Prakasam. Telangana: Frequent infestations in Karimnagar, Warangal, Nizamabad due to continuous Black Gram cultivation.
	Symptoms & Visual Indicators
Early Stage (Eggs & Nymphs)
* Symptoms: Tiny yellowish eggs laid on the underside of leaves.
* Visual Indicator: Small white nymphs clustered on the underside of young leaves.
Mid-Stage (Adult Whiteflies)
* Symptoms: Sticky honeydew secretion, leading to black sooty mold on leaves.
* Visual Indicator: Small white flies flying around when disturbed.
Advanced Stage (Severe Infestation)
* Symptoms: Severe yellowing, leaf curling, stunted growth, and virus transmission (Yellow Mosaic Virus - YMV).
* Visual Indicator: Leaves turn pale yellow, covered with black fungal mold.
Prevention & Control
Cultural Practices
* Avoid Excess Fertilization: Too much nitrogen promotes Whitefly growth.
* Intercropping with Maize or Sorghum: Reduces Whitefly attraction to Black Gram.
* Timely Sowing (June-July): Prevents peak Whitefly infestation periods.
* Crop Sanitation: Regularly remove weeds and debris to reduce Whitefly habitats.
Biological Controls
* Release of Encarsia formosa (Parasitic Wasps): Natural predators of Whitefly nymphs.
* Neem-Based Sprays (Azadirachtin 1%): Reduces Whitefly populations.
* Encouraging Spiders and Ladybird Beetles to feed on Whiteflies.
Chemical Controls
* Use only when infestation exceeds ETL (Economic Threshold Level = 5-10 adults per leaf).
* Pesticide Dosage and Mode of Action:
   * Imidacloprid 17.8 SL: 0.3 ml/L water, systemic insecticide, disrupts nerve signals.
   * Thiamethoxam 25 WG: 0.3 g/L water, inhibits feeding and kills Whiteflies.
   * Spiromesifen 22.9 SC: 1 ml/L water, targets nymphs and adult Whiteflies.

	What are Whiteflies?
	Whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci) are tiny sap-sucking insects that damage Black Gram by removing plant juices and spreading viruses.
	How do Whiteflies spread in the field?
	Whiteflies spread through wind and plant-to-plant movement.
	Can Whiteflies affect other crops?
	Yes, they also attack Cotton, Tomato, and Chilli plants.
	Are all Whiteflies harmful?
	Some species are less damaging, but Bemisia tabaci is a major agricultural pest.
	What are the symptoms of Whitefly infestation?
	Symptoms include yellowing leaves, curling, honeydew secretion, and black sooty mold.
	How do I identify Whiteflies early?
	Look for tiny yellow eggs under leaves and white flying insects when shaking plants.
	What is the impact of honeydew secretion?
	Honeydew attracts fungal infections (black mold) and reduces photosynthesis.
	Can Whiteflies cause complete crop failure?
	In severe cases, Whiteflies can spread Yellow Mosaic Virus (YMV), leading to heavy yield loss.
	When do Whiteflies attack Black Gram?
	Infestation is highest in hot, dry weather during Kharif and Rabi seasons.
	Does rain affect Whiteflies?
	Yes, rain washes off Whiteflies and reduces their population.
	Can excessive irrigation reduce Whitefly infestation?
	Yes, frequent overhead irrigation discourages Whiteflies.
	Which month is the highest risk for Whiteflies?
	August-October sees the most Whitefly outbreaks.
	2️⃣ Scenario-Based Queries
Scenario Query
	Response
	What pests affect Black Gram during hot weather?
	Major pests include Whiteflies, Thrips, and Leafhoppers, which thrive in dry, warm conditions.
	How to control Whiteflies organically?
	Use Neem oil sprays, intercropping with Marigold, and release of parasitic wasps like Encarsia formosa.
	Which plants attract more Whiteflies near Black Gram?
	Cotton, Tomato, and Chilli are highly attractive to Whiteflies.
	What are early warning signs of Whitefly infestation?
	Small white insects flying when plants are disturbed, sticky honeydew secretion, and yellowing leaves.
	Can mulching reduce Whitefly infestation?
	Yes, silver-colored plastic mulching repels Whiteflies and reduces their movement.
	3️⃣ Visual Indicator Queries
Query
	Response
	What do Whiteflies look like?
	Whiteflies are tiny white-winged insects that gather under leaves and fly when disturbed.
	How do I identify Whitefly infestation early?
	Look for yellow eggs under leaves, white insects on shaking, and sticky honeydew deposits.
	Why are my Black Gram leaves turning yellow and curling?
	Likely due to Whitefly infestation, removing sap and spreading Yellow Mosaic Virus (YMV).
