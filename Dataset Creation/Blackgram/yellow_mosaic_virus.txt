Core Information
Field
	Details
	Disease Name
	Yellow Mosaic Virus (YMV)
	Scientific Name
	Mungbean Yellow Mosaic Virus (MYMV) / Mungbean Yellow Mosaic India Virus (MYMIV)
	Category
	Viral Disease (Begomovirus, Family: Geminiviridae)
	Severity Index
	5/5 (Severe Economic Impact)
	Seasonal Patterns
	Peak infection during Kharif (Monsoon) and early Rabi (Winter) seasons, correlating with high whitefly populations.
	Environmental Factors
	Prefers warm temperatures (25-35°C), moderate humidity (60-80%), and spreads via whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) vectors. Also survives in seeds (seed-borne) and plant debris.
	Region
	Andhra Pradesh, Telangana
	Region-Specific Info
	Andhra Pradesh: High occurrences in Krishna, Guntur, Prakasam. Telangana: Warangal, Nizamabad, Karimnagar face severe outbreaks due to continuous cropping.
	Symptoms & Visual Indicators
Early Stage (Initial Infection)
* Symptoms: Small yellow specks along leaf veins, progressing to irregular chlorotic patches.
* Visual Indicator: "Yellow mottle" (generalized yellowing) or "necrotic mottle" (yellow spots with necrosis) on leaves16.
Mid-Stage (Leaf Yellowing)
* Symptoms: Bright yellow mosaic patterns with green islands, downward leaf curling, and stunted growth.
* Visual Indicator: Leaves show alternating yellow-green patches resembling a chessboard47.
Advanced Stage (Severe Infection)
* Symptoms: Complete leaf yellowing, brittle leaves, malformed pods, and 50-80% yield loss.
* Visual Indicator: Internode shortening, wrinkled leaves, and shriveled seeds in pods25.
Prevention & Control
Cultural Practices
1. Use Certified YMV-Resistant Varieties: LBG-752 (Andhra Pradesh) and LBG-20 (Telangana) show partial resistance.
2. Seed Treatment: Hot water treatment (55°C for 30 mins) to eliminate seed-borne viruses5.
3. Rogue Infected Plants: Uproot and burn symptomatic plants immediately.
4. Avoid Adjacent Host Crops: Remove alternate hosts like Green Gram and Soybean near fields.
Biological Controls
1. Whitefly Management:
   * Release Encarsia formosa (parasitizes whitefly nymphs).
   * Spray 5% NSKE (Neem Seed Kernel Extract) to deter whiteflies.
2. Barrier Cropping: Plant maize/sorghum around fields to block whitefly migration.
Chemical Controls
⚠️ Apply insecticides only when whitefly populations exceed 5 adults per leaf (ETL).

	What is Yellow Mosaic Virus (YMV)?
	YMV is a whitefly-transmitted begomovirus causing mosaic yellowing and severe yield loss.
	How does YMV spread?
	Primarily via whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci), but also through infected seeds5.
	Can YMV affect other crops?
	Yes, it infects Green Gram, Cowpea, and Soybean. MYMIV is more virulent in South India67.
	Does YMV survive in soil?
	No, but it persists in seeds and plant debris for months.
	What are YMV symptoms?
	Symptoms include yellow mosaic patterns, leaf curling, and malformed pods.
	How to distinguish YMV from nutrient deficiencies?
	YMV causes irregular yellow patches, while deficiencies show uniform discoloration.
	Can YMV be seed-borne?
	Yes, MYMV DNA is detected in seed coats and embryos5.
	What if YMV is untreated?
	50-80% yield loss; pods become unmarketable due to shriveled seeds24.
	When does YMV occur?
	Peak outbreaks in July-October (monsoon) when whitefly populations surge.
	Does rain reduce YMV?
	Heavy rain temporarily reduces whiteflies but doesn’t eliminate seed-borne virus5.
	Can neem oil control YMV?
	Neem oil reduces whiteflies by 60-70%, slowing viral spread7.
	Which crops increase YMV risk?
	Growing Soybean or Green Gram nearby raises infection risk due to shared whitefly vectors.
	2️⃣ Scenario-Based Queries
Scenario Query
	Response
	What diseases affect Black Gram during monsoon?
	Major threats: YMV, Cercospora Leaf Spot, and Bacterial Leaf Blight.
	How to manage YMV in organic farming?
	Use NSKE sprays, YMV-resistant varieties, and maize barrier crops.
	Which conditions favor YMV?
	Warm (25-35°C), dry weather with moderate humidity (60-80%)47.
	Early signs of YMV?
	Yellow specks on young leaves + whiteflies on leaf undersides.
	Does reflective mulching help?
	Yes, silver plastic mulch repels whiteflies, reducing YMV spread by 40-50%4.
	3️⃣ Visual Indicator Queries
Query
	Response
	What does YMV look like?
	Bright yellow mosaic patterns with green islands; leaves curl downward.
	How to confirm YMV early?
	Test seeds/leaves via PCR or ELISA; field kits are available for farmers57.
	Why are pods shriveled?
	YMV disrupts nutrient flow to pods, causing seed abortion and deformation24.
