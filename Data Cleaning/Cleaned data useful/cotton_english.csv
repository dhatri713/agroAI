rats do not live in fields where sheep penning is being practiced.
planting closely notchi( vitex negundo) and erukku (calotropis gigantea) around the fields as a fence helps to control rat problem.
putting the branches of thangarali (tecoma stands) around the fields to control rats.
'to control rats in paddy fields, channampoo (cycas cercinalis) flowers are cut in to pieces and placed in many places whose bad odour drives away the rats.
pieces of palmyra (borassus flabellifei) leaves are tied on the poles fixed on the field. the sound produced by the leaves scares away the / rats
providing owl stands near the rat holes will help in reducing the rat damage.
to reduce rat population, rat holes are dug and rats are killed after each harvest.
to catch the rats, a trap made up of wire loops on bamboo pegs is being used.   
big round shaped earthen pots are burried on the field at ground level. half of the pot is filled with mud slurry on which baiting material is put on a coconut shell. attracted rats fall inside the pot and they cannot climb up and get killed.
use of soaked rice as bait attracts more rats.

cotton farming comes with its own set of problems. the hard work starts long before harvest. traditionally, farmers hire labors to help young crops survive the onslaught of weeds – by pulling them out by hand. left unchecked, weeds compete for nutrients with cotton plants. if they win and deprive the crop of nutrients, growth and yields suffer.

soil depletion
cvr's method involves digging a trench and scooping up subsoil from a depth of 4 feet. the subsoil is then spread across the field after scraping away the top soil.
pest control
the dry subsoil is filtered and made into a liquid, which is then sprinkled on the leaves and stems of crops. the pests feed on the clay-rich soil and die because they can't digest it.
nutrient supply
the subsoil can be sprayed on crops to provide natural nutrients. the composition of the spray varies depending on the crop and the quality of the soil.
yield increase
cvr's method can increase crop yields. for example, he recorded a paddy yield of 10.31 tonnes per hectare, compared to the normal yield of 5-6.5 tonnes per",en
