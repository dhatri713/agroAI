lumivia insecticide information ,"product description
lumivia provides excellent protection against early-season insect pests, including wireworms, white grubs, cutworms, armyworms and seed corn maggot* (european chafer). it also protects the crop against insect pests that feed on foliage, such as cutworms. with lumivia seed treatment protection in place, growers can more easily achieve a uniform, healthy stand – and be rewarded with more bushels at the end of the season.
technical content
chlorantraniliprole 625 g/l
features & benefits

lumivia contains a unique mode of action that rapidly protects corn seeds and seedlings up to the 4-5 leaf stage against early-season, below-ground insect pests, like wireworm, white grub, cutworm and seed corn maggot*. it also protects the crop against insect pests that feed on foliage, such as cutworms.

benefits

lumivia provides immediate protection of seed and seedlings, resulting in uniform and healthy stand establishment​ that protects yield potential through improved early season vigour​. multi-year trials have shown that lumivia consistently provides a 3.2 bu/ac yield advantage compared to a fungicide only seed treatment
