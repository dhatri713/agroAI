deltamethrin is the world's most effective synthetic pyrethroid insecticide for use in agriculture, being photostable. it is a non-systemic insecticide that acts by contact and ingestion and exhibits a broad-spectrum control of chewing and sucking insects.

technical content: deltamethrin 2.8 ec (2.8% w/wv)

mode of action :

decis acts on the insects by contact and ingestion. its high lipophilicity provides a high affinity with the insect cuticle. in the insect body, it affects nerve transmission by acting on axons. it disrupts the conduction of the nervous influx by modifying the kinetics of the function of the sodium canal.

insecticide resistance action committee (irac) classification no. 3 a 

 

method of application:- spray

spectrum:- bollworm, fruit borer, leaf folder, fruit borer

compatibility:- compatible with sticking agents

applicable crops:- cotton, paddy, tea, tomato, okra, chilli, onion.

advantages :

remarkable knockdown effect.

deltamethrin exhibits good residual activity due to a range of specific physico-chemical properties:

solubility in fatty tissues allows good penetration into the cuticle of leaves.

very low solubility in water gives a good rain fastness.

very low vapor pressure and therefore a good resistance to evaporation.

most effective synthetic pyrethroid because of a single pure isomer.

demonstrates repellent action and anti-feeding properties.

excellent rain-fastness.
