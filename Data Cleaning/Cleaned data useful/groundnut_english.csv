farmer asked query on tata metri herbicides (metribuzin 70% wp) uses ,"tata metri herbicide is an effective herbicide that has a metribuzin molecule that belongs to the triazine group, and it inhibits photosynthesis in photo-system ii.
metri herbicide works to control weeds in sugarcane, potato, tomato, soybean, and wheat.
tata metri herbicide (metribuzin 70% wp) acts through the roots and leaves and, therefore, can be used for pre-and post-emergence applications.
tata metri metribuzin controls both narrow and broadleaf weeds.
metribuzin effectively controls phalaris minor, which has developed resistance to most herbicides and many other types of grass and broadleaf weeds.
metribuzin is economical because of its broad-spectrum activity and low dose.
metri tata rallis leaves no residual effect on succeeding crops.
selective weeds are eradicated in sugarcane, potato, tomato, soybean, and wheat.
