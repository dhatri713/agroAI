sunrice herbicide dosage per acre," 50 gms per acre
sunrice is a post-emergent broad spectrum herbicide very effective for the control of sedges and broad leaf weeds in transplanted rice. sunrice contains ethoxysulfuron as active ingredient which belongs to sulfonyl urea group of herbicides. when combined with grass herbicide like ricestar as tankmix it can offer total weed control in rice.

mode of action
ethoxysulfuron is mainly taken up by the leaves and is translocated within the plant. after inhibition of plant growth, chlorotic patches develop and spread at first acropetally, then basipetally. the action of the product reaches its conclusion about 3-4 weeks after application with the death of the whole plant. ethoxysulfuron acts by inhibition of the acetolactate.

snails and slugs control in paddy ,"management
did a snail eat my plant? 
did a snail eat my plant? (1:30)

a good snail and slug management program relies on a combination of methods. the first step is to eliminate, as much as possible, all places where they can hide during the day. boards, stones, debris, weedy areas around tree trunks, leafy branches growing close to the ground, and dense ground covers, such as ivy, are ideal sheltering spots.

though baits can be part of a management program, it is best to use them in conjunction with habitat modification, especially in gardens that contain plenty of shelter, food, and moisture.

cultural control
it will not be possible to eliminate some shelters, such as low ledges on fences, the undersides of wooden decks, and water meter boxes, so make a regular practice of trapping and removing snails and slugs from these areas.

place vegetable gardens or susceptible plants as far away from snail and slug hiding areas as possible. reducing hiding places allows fewer snails and slugs to survive. the survivors congregate in the remaining shelters, where you can more easily locate and remove them.

switching from sprinkler irrigation to drip irrigation will reduce humidity and moist surfaces, making the habitat less favorable for these pests. irrigating near sunrise will reduce the amount of time that foliage and ground are moist.

solarizing the soil—a technique that uses a clear plastic tarp and the sun's heat—is a good way to kill eggs in raised beds. see the pest notes: soil solarization for gardens and landscapes for more information. eggs will also rapidly dry if on the soil surface. if snail eggs are detected in the bed or garden, shallow cultivation will bring them to the soil surface to dry out.",en

thrips: thrips are tiny insects that feed on plant sap and can damage fruits, vegetables, and ornamental plants.
whiteflies: whiteflies are small, flying insects that infest greenhouse crops and other plants and are susceptible to profenophos.
leafhoppers: profenophos can control leafhoppers, which are known to transmit plant diseases and damage crops.
scale insects: certain scale insect species that infest ornamental plants can be targeted for control.
mealybugs: mealybugs are soft-bodied insects that feed on plant sap and can infest a variety of crops and ornamental plants.
certain beetle species: profenophos is effective against certain beetle species, including those that damage crops such as corn, potatoes, and fruits.
leaf-eating caterpillars: some caterpillar species that damage agricultural crops and ornamental plants can be targeted for control.
sawflies: sawflies, which are related to wasps and can damage the foliage of certain plants, can also be controlled using profenophos.
the specific choice of target pests may vary depending on the crop, pest pressures in a particular region, and the specific application needs. proper pest identification is essential to determine the specific target pests and to use the product effectively and safely. additionally, it's important to follow local regulations and guidelines for pesticide use to ensure safe and effective pest control.

fenoxaprop-p-ethyl is absorbed by the leaves and stems of the plants and is translocated systemically. it predominantly inhibits the synthesis of fatty acids in the meristem tissue of grassy weeds.

effective grass control - a wide range of grasses controlled.

excellent plant selectivity - safe to crops at recommended dosages.

flexibility in application time - 3-5 leaf stages, used as early post emergent herbicide.
