farmer asked query on buprofezin 15% + acephate 35% features and benefits:,"piranha insecticide, one of the mixing partners of buprofezin (contact action), is an insect growth regulator (igr), which inhibits the chitin synthesis of immature insects and disrupts their normal growth.

coromandel piranha is another mixing partner. acephate is a systemic and contact-action insecticide that increases the enzyme acetylcholine(ach), resulting in paralysis and death of the target insect.

piranha insecticide works quicker, and its long-lasting effect helps manage bph and wbph in rice crops.

ఈ వాసన పంట వాసన కంటే ఘాటుగా ఉండి సులభంగా వ్యాపించి పందులను పంట వాసన పసిగట్టకుండా చేయడం వలన  పందులు దూరం నుండి వెనుకకు వెళ్లిపోతాయి.  అందువల్ల అవి పంట పొలాల వైపుకు రావడానికి సుమకుత చూపవు.  వాసన ఎక్కువ రోజులు వ్యాపించి ఉండాలంటే  10 రోజులకు ఒక మారు 50-70 లీ. నీటికి  40-50 కోడి గ్రుడ్లను  కలిపి తరుచుగా పిచికారీ చేసుకోవాలి.
