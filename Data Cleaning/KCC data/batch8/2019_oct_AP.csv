Young trees trained to a single stem, with no branches upto or above 45 cm from the ground level are more prone to sunburn. Such stems may be protected by white washing the stems rather than by wrapping them with paper or such other material.
Thatches, with any type of dried grass or dried stalks of sorghum, maize or bajra, may be erected over and alround the young plants, leaving a gap on the south eastern side for the entry of sunshine and air to protect them from scorching sunshine and hot winds during summer.
During these months timely and frequent irrigation should be given. Care should be taken to remove the weeds from the basins and to mulch the basins with suitable material.
During rainy season water is not allowed to stagnate around the plant, as it is injurious to the roots, especially to the graft union.
Good drainage during rainy season is very essential.
For protecting the young plants from low temperatures and at times from frost, their trunks may be wrapped with gunny cloth or any other durable material.
Frequent irrigations during winter also safeguard the plants against low temperatures or frost",2019-10-02T06:41:26.08,2019,10

* For Tissue culture banana, apply 50% extra fertilizers at 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th
month after planting.
Hill bananas
After forming semicircular basins on uphill side, apply 375 g of 40:30:40 NPK
mixture, plus 130 g Muriate of Potash per clump per application during October,
January and April. Preceding the chemical fertilizer application, apply
Azospirillum and Phosphobacterium @ 20 gm each at planting and 5th month
after planting.
Apply N as Neem coated urea. Apply N and K in 3 splits on 3rd, 5th and 7th month,
Phosphorous at 3rd month of planting. Apply 20 g in each of Azospirillum and
Phosphobacteria during planting and five months after planting. (This should be
applied prior to chemical fertilizer application).
The fertigation technique must be followed for maximizing the productivity. Apply
200:30:300 g N: P2O5: K2O / plant using water soluble fertilizers along with 25
litres of water/day. For economizing the cost of fertilizers, fertigate using normal 
fertilizers (Urea and Muriate of potash) with 50% of the recommended dose
along with recommended dose of phosphorus as basal at 2nd month after
planting. Fertigate at weekly intervals as per the following schedule.

Take 2 kg jaggery and mixed it in a plastic drum containing 200 liters water.
Now take 1 bottle of waste decomposer and pour all its contents in a plastic drum containing jaggery solution. Avoid direct contact of contents with hands.

Cover the drum with a paper or cardboard and stir it every day once or twice.
After 5 days the solution of drum turns creamy.
Farmers could prepare the waste decomposer solution again and again from the above formed solution. For this, 20 liter of waste decomposer solution is added to a drum with 2 kg of jaggery and 20 liter water is added.

ANDHRA PRADESH,ANANTPUR,VAJRAKARUR,NA,AGRICULTURE,Pulses,Bengal Gram (Gram/Chick Pea/Kabuli/Chana),Varieties,bengal gram nandyal sanaga-3 variety ,"recommended to The chickpea revolution in Andhra Pradesh has improved the prospects of many resource-poor, small land holding and rainfed farmers of Andhra Pradesh. However, the growing season of chickpea in Andhra Pradesh is warm and short (90-110 days), and drought is the foremost factor responsible for significant yield losses. Rainfall in major chickpea-growing regions is quite uncertain and erratic, resulting in poor yields. The Regional Agricultural Research Station of Acharya N G Ranga Agricultural University, Nandyal, Andhra Pradesh, India is the lead centre responsible for location-specific research in chickpea in Andhra Pradesh. With support from ICRISAT and ICAR, the centre has initiated crop improvement programmes during 2004 and has released four promising chickpea varieties for commercial cultivation. Three desi varieties viz., Nandyal Sanaga 1(NBeG 3), Dheera (NBeG 47), and Nandyal Gram 49 (NBeG 49) released for Andhra Pradesh and one large-seeded kabuli Nandyal Gram 119 (NBeG 119) released for the southern zone comprising Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, are cutting across chickpea growing regions of Andhra Pradesh. Nandyal Sanaga 1, released in 2012, is a bold-seeded desi variety tolerant to drought and heat; Dheera released during 2015 is also a desi variety and the first of its kind in India, suitable for mechanical harvesting.",2019-10-06T07:58:15.673,2019,10
