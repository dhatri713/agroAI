Irrigate at sowing and give life irrigation 7 days after sowing depending on the soil and climatic condition and allow excess water to percolate.
Give one pre-flowering irrigation (25 days): One at flowering and one or two at pod setting. An irrigation at flowering period is critical.
NOTE: The critical stage for moisture requirement is the flowering phase i.e, between 35th to 45th days of sowing. During the maturity phase, moisture status should be low. If more water is given during this phase, maturity of seeds is affected and filling up of the capsules will be poor. Therefore, stop irrigation after 65 days of sowing.
