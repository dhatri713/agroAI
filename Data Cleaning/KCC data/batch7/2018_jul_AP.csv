Guava grows well both in wet and dry regions but it does better under irrigation in the dry tracts. It can be grown upto 1000 m altitude.  Well drained soils are the best suited for guava cultivation. It can tolerate salinity and alkalinity.  In saline soils add 3 Kg Gypsum/plant during planting and once in three years after planting to overcome the problem. 

Planting material
Layers are used as planting material.


	


Season of planting
The planting is distributed from June - December.

Spacing 
A spacing 5 - 6m in either way is generally followed.

Planting
Plant the layers with the ball of earth in the centre of pit of 45 cm x 45 cm x 45 cm size filled with FYM 10 Kg neem cake 1 Kg and top soil

Irrigation
Irrigate copiously immediately after planting, again on third day and afterwards once in 10 days or as and when necessary.",2018-07-09T13:16:01.627,2018,7
