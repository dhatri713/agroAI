Seeds should be dry and free of soil deposits and clean at treatment Gaucho is a seed treatment product with excellent systemic properties acting through the roots, ensuring protection of the plant against pests from the time of sowing well into the growing period. It has a broad spectrum of activity, particularly against sucking pests. In the soil, the active ingredient is released from the seed and forms a treatment-halo around the seed. Gaucho is absorbed very efficiently by the germinating plant and is transported in the sap-flow to the stem and leaves.

After feeding, the leeches will have difficulty leaving the can. Destruction of the contents of the can will help in reducing the size of the leech population.

A metal can with a reclosable lid (a one pound tobacco or coffee can is ideal) drilled with small holes (depending on the size of the nuisance species) and baited with raw meat may trap large numbers of leeches from a heavily infested area. After feeding, the leeches will have difficulty leaving the can. Destruction of the contents of the can will help in reducing the size of the leech population.
