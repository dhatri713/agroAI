ANDHRA PRADESH,PRAKASAM,MARTUR,NA,AGRICULTURE,Pulses,Bengal Gram (Gram/Chick Pea/Kabuli/Chana),	Water Management	,BENGAL GRAM WATER MANAGEMENT ,"Another major area where pulse production can be improved is under irrigated conditions. Because of availability of short duration varieties of pulses including redgram majority of pulses can be fitted into annual rotations.
The potential evapotranspiration of Chickpea crop ranged from 200-280 mm, depending on the crop season. Although, most of the chickpea crop in India is grown on moisture conserved in the soil from the rain received prior to planting, the crop responds favourably to supplemental irrigation.
Irrigation during the pre-flowering period (at the early stage of vegetative growth on soils having low water holding capacity and at late vegatative phase on heavier and deeper soils) and at early pod filling stage results in increasing yields.
Irrigation improves the nodulation and increase the yield by increased pod number/plant.

Soil Moisture

Being a rabi crop, gram is raised on the moisture conserved in the soil during the monsoon and is, therefore, subjected to deficiency thereoff in unfavourable seasons.
Likewise, not too infrequently, excess moisture may be equally harmful as the crop may be affected not only by lack of aeration but also by poor nodulation and low rhizobial activity.
Improved cultural practices, like bunding, land levelling, adoption of proper dry farming practices, stirring the soil to improve infiltration, etc., are therefore necessary.
Bunding and stirring the soil with the desi plough in the rainy months increases the yield of gram.
Stirring with a spring-tine harrow was as effective as that with the desi plough.

Irrigation

The crop is irrigated once or twice only when the soil gets much dried up in November or December. Further irrigation may not be needed. While irrigating necessary care should be exercised that there should not be waste stagnation.",2018-12-11T08:42:44.5,2018,12

If the planting is done too early, plants lack vigour and result in low yield and quality of fruits. If planted very late, runners develop in March and crops are light.

 

Runners are uprooted from nursery, made into bundles and planted in the field. These can be kept in cold storage before transplanting.

 

The soil should be frequently irrigated to reduce water stress in the leaf.  Defoliation suppresses the plant growth, delays fruiting and reduces yield & quality.",2018-12-11T12:53:01.13,2018,12

It is sown during the month of November on receipt of rainfall.
It is mostly grown on water retentive clay soils and hence the water requirement is less.
As it is grown during Winter season, the day and night temperature is low hence the water loss is less.
If rain fall fails one or two irrigations during flowering and pod formation stage is essential.
Four to six leaf stage/branching and pod formations stage are the most critical, although the crop shows enough tolerance to a delay in the timing of these irrigations.

Basal application of DAP is recommended when the seedlings are to be pulled out in 20-25 days after sowing in less fertile nursery soils.

For that situation, before the last puddling, apply 40kg of DAP and if not readily available, apply straight fertilizers 16kg of urea and 120kg of super phosphate.

If seedlings are to be pulled out after 25 days, application of DAP is to be done 10 days prior to pulling out.

For clayey soils where root snapping is a problem, 4kg of gypsum and 1kg of DAP/cent can be applied at 10 days after sowing.",2018-12-13T20:51:43.933,2018,12

Basal application of DAP is recommended when the seedlings are to be pulled out in 20-25 days after sowing in less fertile nursery soils.

For that situation, before the last puddling, apply 40kg of DAP and if not readily available, apply straight fertilizers 16kg of urea and 120kg of super phosphate.

If seedlings are to be pulled out after 25 days, application of DAP is to be done 10 days prior to pulling out.

For clayey soils where root snapping is a problem, 4kg of gypsum and 1kg of DAP/cent can be applied at 10 days after sowing.",2018-12-13T20:48:46.807,2018,12

The use of organic manures (farmyard manure, compost, green manure, etc.) is the oldest and most widely practised means of nutrient replenishment in India.Makes soil more fertile when used in less fertile and unfertile lands.

Increases soil moisture holding capacity upto 30-40%.

Contains Bacteria which can synthesize Nitrogen from air, Phosphorous in soil and other secondary and micro nutrients. It is also rich in growth promoters.

Other than making soil fertile, plants grow healthy with more pests and disease resistant.

Crop yield is increased with increase in quality parameters like taste, flavour, colour etc.",2018-12-05T09:09:34.453,2018,12
