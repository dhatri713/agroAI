The crop should be irrigated by adopting the ring method of irrigation so that the water does not come in direct contact with the stem. In the case of new plantings, preventing water logging of the soil may control the disease. The soil should be drenched with 2-3 litres of Copper Oxychloride (3 g per litre of water). The application should be carried out regularly at 15 days interval from the time of planting. During fruit formation, the plant should be sprayed with the same solution at the same time interval. Alternately, Mancozeb (2.5 g/ litre of water) may also be applied. In the case of disease attack in existing crops, the rotted portion of the plant should be scraped and Copper Oxychloride or Bordeaux paste should be applied. The paste can be prepared by dissolving one kg of Copper Sulphate and lime separately in ten litres of water each. The two solutions should be mixed and shaken to form a paste. The base of the plant should be drenched with three litres of Copper Oxychloride (3g/litre). The plant should be drenched during fruit formation with Copper Oxychloride or Mancozeb at the earlier mentioned concentrations twice at 15 days interval.",2018-04-10T16:07:19.277,2018,4
