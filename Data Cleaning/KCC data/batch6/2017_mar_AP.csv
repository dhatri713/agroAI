More water is poured on to raise the water level to about 10 cm 
• About 0.5-1kg of pure mother azolla culture seed material is spread uniformly over the water, after mild stirring of soil and water in the azolla bed. Fresh water should be sprinkled over the azolla immediately after inoculation to make the azolla plants upright • In a week’s time, the azolla spreads all over the bed and develops a thick mat like appearance. • A mixture of 20 g of Super Phosphate and about 1 kg of cow dung should be added once in 5 days in order to maintain rapid multiplication of the azolla and to maintain the daily yield of 500 g • A micronutrient mix containing magnesium, iron, copper, sulphur etc., can also be added at weekly intervals to enhance the mineral content of azolla • About 5 kg of bed soil should be replaced with fresh soil, once in 30 days, to avoid nitrogen build up and prevent micro-nutrient deficiency • 25 to 30 percent of the water also needs to be replaced with fresh water, once every 10 days, to prevent nitrogen build up in the bed • The bed should be cleaned, the water and soil replaced and new azolla inoculated once every six months • A fresh bed has to be prepared and inoculated with pure culture of azolla, when contaminated by pest and diseases
