ANDHRA PRADESH,CHITTOOR,YERRAVARIPALEM,NA,AGRICULTURE,Cereals,Paddy (Dhan),Varieties,basmathi rice information,"Progressive farmers in the district have gone for Basmati cultivation again. The farmers, who faced hardship earlier, resumed cultivation in view of profits involved. There was a lull for two years as millers shied away from buying Basmati rice.

The millers from Kakinada have guaranteed a price of Rs. 2,500 per quintal to the farmers. They expected to pocket an extra sum of Rs.900 per quintal. In addition, the cost of cultivation comes down by not less than Rs. 4,000.

Apart from being high yielding, it is also a short duration variety and takes less time for cultivation. Average expenses, including fertilisers, per acre are less than Rs. 15,000 per acre. “It is far less compared to the traditional varieties,” says Potluri Rajaiah, a farmer from Mukhasa Kalavapalli village in Mandavailli mandal.

Kisan Service Organisation (KSO) secretary P.S.R. Das says that they encouraged farmers to cultivate the new variety as it can be exported. The Pusa 1509 variety has become popular among the farmers due to its high yield as compared to Pusa-1121. “The Pusa 1509 variety has all the qualities of Basmati in terms of elongation, aroma, non-stickiness, softness and fluffy texture,” he says.

Earlier, farmers cultivated Pusa-1121 variety in 159 acre in 2010-11. The yield ranged between 20 and 25 bags per acre. Also, the cost of cultivation is just Rs.10, 000 per acre, while it is Rs.15, 000 per acre for the normal variety.

The farmers had a bitter experience in the past as the millers did not show interest in buying the rice. Mr. Das explains that the millers could not export Pusa 1121 as there were shortfalls in milling.

About 40 farmers cultivated Pusa 1509 variety in about 1,000 acre in the district. The farmers are expecting a yield of 30 bags (75 kg each) per acre.

The Basmati is being cultivated in mandals like Kaikaluru, Kalidindi, Agiripalli, Bapulapadu and Nagayalanka in the district.",2016-06-23T17:23:46.643,2016,6
