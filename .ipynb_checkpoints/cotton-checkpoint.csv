ప్రత్తి మొలకెత్తిన నెల రోజులకు చేనులో వచ్చు లేత గడ్డి మరియు వెడల్పాకు గల కలుపు నివారణకు – క్వాజలోఫాస్ ఇధైల్ (టర్గా సూపర్) 400 మి.లీ. లేదా ప్రోపాక్విజాఓఫాస్ (ఎజిల్) 250 మి.లీ. మరియు పైరిథయోబ్యాక్ సోడియం (హిట్ వీడ్/థీమ్/ రైఫ్) 250 మి.లీ. 200 లీటర్ల నీటిలో కలిరి రిచికారి చేయాలి.

కలుపు మందులతో పాటుగా ప్రత్తిలో సమాయానుకూలంగా, ప్రతీ వారం, పదిరోజులులకొకసారి గొర్రు, గుంటకలతో 60-70 రోజుల వరకు పలు దఫాలుగా అంతరకృషి చేసినట్లయితే కలుపు నివారణతో పాటు, పైరు పెరుగుదల బాగా ఉండి, భూమిలో ఎక్కువ తేమ నిల్వవుండి, తద్వారా అధిక దిగుబడులు పొందడానికి దోహదం చేస్తుంది.

వర్షాలు ఎక్కువగా ఉండి, అంతరకృషి ద్వారా కలుపు నివారణ వీలు కాని పరిస్థితులలో పారాక్వాట్ 5 మి.లీ. లేదా గ్లేఫోసేట్ 10 మి.లీ. మరియు 10 గ్రా. ల యూరియాతో లీటరు నీటికి కలిపి ప్రత్తి మొక్కలపై పడకుండా, పరుసల మధ్య కలుపు మీద మాత్రమే పడేటట్లుగా పిచికారి చేస్తే, కలుపు నివారణ బాగా జరుగుతుంది.

ప్రస్తుతానికి ప్రత్తిలో వాడటానికి సమర్థమంతమైన అంతరకృషి యంత్రం లేదు. కాని డ్రిప్ పద్దతిలో ప్రత్తిని సాగుచేసేటప్పుడు, వరుసల మధ్య దూరం 5 అడుగులు వున్నట్లయితే కుబొటా లాంటి చిన్న ట్రాక్టర్ తో అంతపకృషి బాగా చేయుకోవచ్చు.

","it’s important to use plant growth regulators (pgrs) to promote crop earliness. pgrs can regulate plant nutrient uptake, increase square and boll retention, and improve overall yield and quality of cotton crops.
along with using a pgr, it is also important to manage fertility to where you don’t create excessive growth situations, which can lead to nutrient imbalances, pest susceptibility and more challenges at harvest.
to avoid overwatering your crops, use available technologies to help time your irrigation schedules. overwatering can create vegetative growth type scenarios with cotton.

సిఫార్సు చేసిన ఎరువులు (ఎకరాకు కిలోల్లో)

సూటి రకాలు(అమొరికన్ రకాలు)	36	18	18

ప్రత్తి సాగు చేయు భీములలో ప్రతీ సంవత్సరం ఎకరాకు 4 టన్నుల బాగా మాగిన పశువుల ఎరువు లేదా ఇతర సేంద్రీయ ఎరువును దుక్కిలో చల్లి కలియదున్నాలి.

సాధారణ / సూటి రకాలను ఎకరాకు 36 కిలోల నత్రజని, 18 కిలోల భాస్వరం మరియు 18 కిలోల పొటాష్ నిచ్చే ఎరువులను వేయాలి. హైబ్రిడ్ రకాలను ఎకరాకు 48 కిలోల నత్రజని, 24 కిలోల భాస్వరం మరియు 24 కిలోల పొటాష్ నిచ్చు ఎరువులను వేయాలి.

సిఫారసు చేసిన భాస్వరం మొత్తాన్ని, సింగల్ సూపర్ ఫాస్ఫేట్ రూపంలో (రకాలకు 100 కిలోలు, హైబ్రిడ్లకు 150 కిలోలు) ఎకరానికి విత్తేముందు ఆఖిరి దుక్కిలో వేసి కలియదున్నాలి లేదా విత్తిన 15 రోజుల లోపు కూడా వేసుకోవచ్చు.

సాధారణ రకాలకైతే సిఫారసు చేసిన నత్రజని మరియు పొటాష్ లను మూడు సమభాగాలుగా చేసి విత్తిన 30,60,90 రోజులకు మొక్కల మొదళ్ళలో 7-10 సెం.మీ. దూరంలో పాదులు తీసి వేయాలి. బిటి హైబ్రిడ్లకు సిఫారసు చేసిన నత్రజని మరియు పొటాష్ లను నాలుగు సమభాగాలుగా చేసి విత్తిన 20,40,60,80 రోజులకు మొక్కల మొదళ్ళలో 7-10 సెం.మీ. దూరంలో పాదులు తీసివేయాలి.

పై పాటుగా వేయు నత్రజని, పొటాష్ లను యూరియా మరియు మ్యూరేట్ ఆఫ్ పోటాష్ రూపంలో అందించాలి. ఎరకాకు రకాలకైతే ప్రతీసారి 25 కీలోల యూరియా మరియు 10 కిలోల మ్యూరేట్ ఆఫ్ పోటాష్ లను 3 సార్లు – 36,60,90 రోజులలో, హైబ్రిడ్లకయితే అదే మొతాదులో 20,40,60,80 రోజులకు అందించాలి.

ప్రధాన పోషకాలను సింగల్ సూపర్ ఫాస్ఫేట్, యూరియా మరియు మ్యూరేట్ ఆఫ్ పోటాష్ రూపంలో అందిస్తే ఖర్చు కూడా తక్కువ అవుతుంది. కాంప్లెక్స్ ఎరువులను వాడినప్పుడు – ఎకరాకు 50 కిలోల డి.ఎ.పి.ని విత్తినప్పుడు వేసి, పైపాటుగా యూరియా, పొటాష్ లను పై విధంగానే అందించాలి. ముఖ్యంగా పైపాటుగా డి.ఎ.పి. లేదా 20:20 లాంటి కాంప్లెక్స్ ఎరువులను వాడకూడదు. దీని వలన ఖర్చు పెరగడమే కాకుండా, భూమిలో భాస్వరపు నిల్వలు ఎక్కువై చైడు భూములుగా మారుతాయి.

పైన సూచించిన అన్ని ఎరువుల మోతాదును భూసార పరీక్షలననుసరించి, ఏదైన పోషకాన్ని సిఫారసు కంటే 30% తక్కువగా మరియు పోషకం మధ్యస్థంగా ఉన్నప్పుడు, సిఫారసు చేసిన ఎరువులను మాత్రమే వాడితే ఫలితం బాగుంటుంది.

ఎక్కువకాలం ప్రత్తి సాగు చేస్తున్న భూముల్లో, ప్రత్యేకంగా వేరు తెగుళ్ళు ఆశించే భూములలో మాత్రం పంట మార్పిడితో పాటు, ఎకరాకు 200 కిలోల వేపపిండిని రెండు – మూడు సంవsత్సరాలు వేయాలి.

cotton pink bollworm ipm practices,"పంట కాలంలో చేపట్టవలసిన యాజమాన్య పద్ధతులు:

ప్రత్తి పంట విత్తిన 45 రోజుల నుండి గులాబి రంగు పురుగు ఉనికిని గమనించడానికి ఎకరాకి 4 లింగాకర్షక బుట్టలను అమర్చి బుట్టలలో వరుసగా మూడు రోజులు 7 లేదా 8 తల్లి రెక్కల పురుగులను పడటం గమనించినట్లయితే లేదా 10% పురుగు ఆశించిన కాయలను గమనించిన వెంటనే సస్యరక్షణ చర్యలు చేపట్టాలి. ఎకరాకు 8 లింగాకర్షక బుట్టలు పెట్టుకుంటే పురుగు ఉధృతిని నియంత్రించవచ్చును.
లింగాకర్షక బుట్టల ఆధారంగా పురుగు ఉధృతిని అంచనా వేసుకొని, నష్టపరిమితికి చేరే సమయంలో ఎకరాకు 4 కార్డుల ట్రైకోగ్రామా టాయిడియా బాక్ట్రే గుడ్డు పరాన్నజీవిని చేనులో వదులుకోవాలి.
పురుగు సష్టపరిమితి స్థాయి దాటిన వెంటనే 5% వేప గింజల కషాయము లేదా 5 మి.లీ. (1500 పి.పి.యమ్) వేప నూనెను లీటరు నీటికి కలిపి పిచికారి చేసుకోవాలి.
క్వినాల్ఫాస్ 2.0 మి.లీ. లేదా థయోడికార్బ్ 1.5 గ్రా లేదా ప్రొఫెనోఫాస్ 2 మి.లీ. లేదా క్లోరిపైరిఫాస్ 2.5 మి.లీ. ఒక లీటరు నీటికి కలిపి పిచికారి చేయాలి.
పంట కాలంలో ఒకటి లేదా రెడు సార్లు మాత్రమే సింథటిక్ పైరిత్రాయిడ్ మందులైన సైపర్ మైథిన్ 25% ఇ.సి. 1.0 మి.లీ లేదా లామ్డాపైహలోత్రిన్ 5.0% ఇ.సి. 1.0 మి.లీ. ఒక లీటరు నీటికి కలిపి పిచికారి చేయాలి.
సింథటిక్ పైరిత్రాయిడ్ మందులు ప్రత్తి పంటపై ఎక్కువ సార్లు పిచికారి చేసుకున్నట్లయితే రసం పీల్చే పురుగుల ఉధృతి పెరిగే అవకాశముంది.



పంట తీసిన తరువాత చేపట్టవలసిన యాజమాన్య పద్ధతులు:


నీటివసతి ఉన్నపటికీ ప్రత్తిని ఏడు నెలలు మించి పొడిగించకుండా తీసివేయాలి. పంటకాలము పొడిగించుచ ద్వారా రాబోయే పంటలో పురుగు ఉధృతి తొలిదశలోనే ఎక్కువయ్యే అవకాశముంది.
నీటివసతి ఉన్నచోట రెండో పంటలుగా ఇతర ఆరుతడి పంటల్ని సాగుచేసుకోవడం వలన పంట మార్పిడి జరగడమే కాకుండా ప్రత్తిలో వచ్చే ఆదాయం కన్నా ఎక్కువ ఆధాయం పొందవచ్చు.
పంట తీసిన తరువాత చేనులో గొర్రెలు, మేకలు, పశువులను తోలి మేపాలి.
ప్రత్తి మొళ్ళను ష్రెడ్డరుతో గాని, రోటావేటరుతో గాని భూమిలో కలియదున్నాలి.
ప్రతి మొళ్లను ఇళ్ళ వద్ద పొయ్యిలో వాడేందుకు నిల్వ చేయకూడదు.
ప్రత్తి తీసిన తరువాత ఎండిన మొళ్ళను, విచ్చుకొని కాయలను పీకివేసి తగులబెట్టి ఆ తరువాత భూమిలో కలియదున్నుట ద్వారా పురుగు కోశస్థ దశలను నాశనం చేయవచ్చును."

cotton pink bollworm nature of damage,"గులాబి రంగు పురుగు వలన జరిగే నష్టం పైకి కనబడదు. కాయలు పగిలినప్పుడు మాత్రమే తెలుస్తుంది. ఎందుకంటే గుడ్ల నుండి వెలువడిన వెంటనే చిన్న లార్వాలు మొగ్గలపైన లేదా కాయలపైన కంటికి కనిపించని సన్నని రంధ్రాలు చేసి లోపలికి ప్రవేశించి తమ జీవిత కాలం మొత్తం కాయలోనే గడుపుతాయి. లేత మొగ్గలను ఆశించి ఎదిగే పువ్వులోని పదార్థాలను తినడం వలన ఆకర్షణ పత్రాలు విప్పుకోకుండా ముడుచుకోనే ఉంటాయి. వీటినే గడ్డిపూలు అంటారు. ఎదిగిన మొగ్గలను ఆశించినప్పుడు పువ్వులు విచ్చుకున్నపటికీ లోపల అండాశయాలను పుప్పోడిని తినడం వలన నష్టం కలుగుతుంది. ఈ విధంగా తొలి దశలో ఆశించినచో మొగ్గలు పూలు రాలిపోతాయి. లేత కాయలను ఆశించినప్పుడు అవి రాలిపోవడం గాని, కాయ పరిమాణం పెరగకపోవడం గాని, కాయలు సరిగ్గా పగలక ఎండిపోయి గుడ్డి కాయలుగా ఏర్పడడం జరుగుతుంది. ఈ పురుగు నష్టాన్ని గుర్తించడానికి పొలంలోని గుడ్డిపూలను, కాయలను తెరిచి లోపలి భాగన్ని చూసినట్లయితే కాయ లోపల చిన్న లేదా పెద్ద గుsలాబి రంగు గొంగళి పురుగులను గమనించవచ్చు. గులాబి రంగు కాయతొలుచు పురుగు ఆశించిన ప్రత్తలో దూది రంగు, నాణ్యత దెబ్బతిని బరువు తగ్గిపోవడం వలన దిగుబడి బాగా తగ్గుతుంది."

farmer asked query on rats cntrol in cotton,"--rat control

rats do not live in fields where sheep penning is being practiced.
planting closely notchi( vitex negundo) and erukku (calotropis gigantea) around the fields as a fence helps to control rat problem.
putting the branches of thangarali (tecoma stands) around the fields to control rats.
'to control rats in paddy fields, channampoo (cycas cercinalis) flowers are cut in to pieces and placed in many places whose bad odour drives away the rats.
pieces of palmyra (borassus flabellifei) leaves are tied on the poles fixed on the field. the sound produced by the leaves scares away the / rats
providing owl stands near the rat holes will help in reducing the rat damage.
to reduce rat population, rat holes are dug and rats are killed after each harvest.
to catch the rats, a trap made up of wire loops on bamboo pegs is being used.   
big round shaped earthen pots are burried on the field at ground level. half of the pot is filled with mud slurry on which baiting material is put on a coconut shell. attracted rats fall inside the pot and they cannot climb up and get killed.
use of soaked rice as bait attracts more rats.
putting fresh cow dung on both the fields and bunds to reduce rat problem."

hitweed herbicide information ?,"hitweed is a post-emergence selective herbicide for broad-leaved weeds control in cotton crops.
cotton farming comes with its own set of problems. the hard work starts long before harvest. traditionally, farmers hire labors to help young crops survive the onslaught of weeds – by pulling them out by hand. left unchecked, weeds compete for nutrients with cotton plants. if they win and deprive the crop of nutrients, growth and yields suffer.
technical content: pyrithiobac sodium 10% e c
dose: 1ml/liter of water
note: mainly use in cotton crop. make sure soil is moist before application.

అంతర పంటల సాగుతో ప్రధాన పంటకు మేలు చేసే మిత్ర పురుగుల సంఖ్య పెరగడమే కాకుండా, వాతావరణ ఒడుదుకుల నుండి కూడా కొంత రక్షణ లభిస్తుంది.

how to control cotton crop pink boll worm control methods ?,"గులాబి రంగు పురుగు:

ఈ పురుగు గత రెండు సంవత్సరాలుగా బిటి ప్రత్తిని కూడా ఆశించి నష్టపరుస్తుంది. పురుగు ఉధృతి, పంట నష్టం రోజురోజుకూ పెరుగుతుంది. ఈ పురుగు నివారణకు సూచించిన పలు సమగ్ర సస్యరక్షణ చర్యలు చేపట్టివట్లయితే, మున్ముందు బిటి ప్రత్తి సాగు కూడా ప్రశ్నార్థకం అవుతుంది. కావున ప్రస్తుత సమయంలో ఈ పురుగు నివారణ చాలా ముఖ్యం.

లక్షణాలు:

తల్ల పురుగు లేత ఆకుల అడుగు భాగాన, లేత కొమ్మలపైన, పూ మొగ్గలపైన, లేత కాయలపైన, రక్షక పత్రాలపైన గుడ్లను గుంపులుగా లేదా విడివిడిగా పెడుతుంది.
గుడ్ల నుండి బయటకి వచ్చిన కంటికి కనిపించని చిన్న లార్వాలు పూ మొగ్గ లోనికి తొలుచుకొని పోయి లోపలి పదార్థములను తిని వీటిని గుడ్డి పూలూగా మారుస్తాయి.
చిన్న లార్వాలు కాయలపై కనిపించనంత చిన్న రంధ్రాలు చేసి, లోనికి ప్రవేశిస్తాయి. తరువాత కాయలకు చేసిన రంధ్రం పూడిపోయి, పురుగు కాయలోనే ఉండి గింజలను తింటూ దూదిని బాగా నష్టపరుస్తుంది. దూది రంగు, నాణ్యత పూర్తిగా దెబ్బతింటాయి.
పురుగు లార్వా దశ మొత్తం కాయలోనే గడపడం వలన, కాయ పగిలిన తరువాత మాత్రమే నష్టాన్ని గుర్తించగలం.
పురుగు ఆశించిన కాయలు పూర్తిగా వృద్ధి చెందక తరువాత పక్వానికి వస్తాయి.
గులాబి రంగు పురుగు ప్రత్తి పంటను నష్టపరుచు విధానం:

గులాబి రంగు పురుగు వలన జరిగే నష్టం పైకి కనబడదు. కాయలు పగిలినప్పుడు మాత్రమే తెలుస్తుంది. ఎందుకంటే గుడ్ల నుండి వెలువడిన వెంటనే చిన్న లార్వాలు మొగ్గలపైన లేదా కాయలపైన కంటికి కనిపించని సన్నని రంధ్రాలు చేసి లోపలికి ప్రవేశించి తమ జీవిత కాలం మొత్తం కాయలోనే గడుపుతాయి. లేత మొగ్గలను ఆశించి ఎదిగే పువ్వులోని పదార్థాలను తినడం వలన ఆకర్షణ పత్రాలు విప్పుకోకుండా ముడుచుకోనే ఉంటాయి. వీటినే గడ్డిపూలు అంటారు. ఎదిగిన మొగ్గలను ఆశించినప్పుడు పువ్వులు విచ్చుకున్నపటికీ లోపల అండాశయాలను పుప్పోడిని తినడం వలన నష్టం కలుగుతుంది. ఈ విధంగా తొలి దశలో ఆశించినచో మొగ్గలు పూలు రాలిపోతాయి. లేత కాయలను ఆశించినప్పుడు అవి రాలిపోవడం గాని, కాయ పరిమాణం పెరగకపోవడం గాని, కాయలు సరిగ్గా పగలక ఎండిపోయి గుడ్డి కాయలుగా ఏర్పడడం జరుగుతుంది. ఈ పురుగు నష్టాన్ని గుర్తించడానికి పొలంలోని గుడ్డిపూలను, కాయలను తెరిచి లోపలి భాగన్ని చూసినట్లయితే కాయ లోపల చిన్న లేదా పెద్ద గుsలాబి రంగు గొంగళి పురుగులను గమనించవచ్చు. గులాబి రంగు కాయతొలుచు పురుగు ఆశించిన ప్రత్తలో దూది రంగు, నాణ్యత దెబ్బతిని బరువు తగ్గిపోవడం వలన దిగుబడి బాగా తగ్గుతుంది.

నివారణ చర్యలు: సమగ్ర యాజమాన్య పద్ధతులను అనుసరించి గులాబి రంగు పురుగును నివారించుకోవాలి. ఇవి ప్రధానంగా పంటలేని సమయాన, విత్తడానికి ముందు, పంటకాలంలో మరియు పంట తీసిన తరువాత చేపట్టవలసిన వివిధ చర్యలు.

పంటలేని సమయాన చేపట్టవలసిన యాజమాన్య పద్ధతులు
ఎండాకాలంలో లోతు దుక్కులు చేసుకొనుట ద్వారా పురుగు యొక్క కోశస్థ దశలను సమర్థవంతంగా నాశనం చేయవచ్చును.
గులాబి రంగు పురుగు ఆశించిన ప్రత్తిని జిన్నింగ్ చేయగా వచ్చిన విత్తనాలను నిల్వ చేయకూడదు. అలా చేసినచో తరువాత పంటకాలంలో దీని ఉధృతి ఎక్కువయ్యే అవకాశముంటుంది.
గులాబి రంగు పురుగు ఆశించిన ప్రత్తిని రైతుల ఇళ్ళ వద్ద గాని లేదా జిన్నింగ్ మిల్లు వద్దగాని నిల్వ ఉంచకూడదు.
ప్రత్తి విత్తడానికి ముందు చేపట్టవలసిన యాజమాన్య పద్ధతులు
పంట మార్పిడి పద్దతిని ప్రతి 2 – 3 సంవత్సరాలకొకసారి విధిగా పాటించాలి.
తక్కువ కాల పరిమితి గల రకాలను ఎంపిక చేసుకొని సకాలంలో విత్తుకోవడం ద్వారా గులాబి రంగు పురుగు ఉధృతిని చాలా వరకు తగ్గించుకోవచ్చు.
బిటి ప్రత్తిని విత్తేటప్పుడు ప్రత్తి చుట్టు 5 వరుసలలో నాన్ బి.టి. ప్రత్తిని విధిగా విత్తుకోవాలి.
ప్రత్తి పొలంలో మరియు చేను చుట్టూ తుత్తురు బెండలాంటి కలుపు మొక్కలు లేకుండా చూసుకోవాలి.
ప్రత్తి పంట దగ్గరలో బెండ పంట లేకుండా చూసుకోవాలి.
పంట కాలంలో చేపట్టవలసిన యాజమాన్య పద్ధతులు
ప్రత్తి పంట విత్తిన 45 రోజుల నుండి గులాబి రంగు పురుగు ఉనికిని గమనించడానికి ఎకరాకి 4 లింగాకర్షక బుట్టలను అమర్చి బుట్టలలో వరుసగా మూడు రోజులు 7 లేదా 8 తల్లి రెక్కల పురుగులను పడటం గమనించినట్లయితే లేదా 10% పురుగు ఆశించిన కాయలను గమనించిన వెంటనే సస్యరక్షణ చర్యలు చేపట్టాలి. ఎకరాకు 8 లింగాకర్షక బుట్టలు పెట్టుకుంటే పురుగు ఉధృతిని నియంత్రించవచ్చును.
లింగాకర్షక బుట్టల ఆధారంగా పురుగు ఉధృతిని అంచనా వేసుకొని, నష్టపరిమితికి చేరే సమయంలో ఎకరాకు 4 కార్డుల ట్రైకోగ్రామా టాయిడియా బాక్ట్రే గుడ్డు పరాన్నజీవిని చేనులో వదులుకోవాలి.
పురుగు సష్టపరిమితి స్థాయి దాటిన వెంటనే 5% వేప గింజల కషాయము లేదా 5 మి.లీ. (1500 పి.పి.యమ్) వేప నూనెను లీటరు నీటికి కలిపి పిచికారి చేసుకోవాలి.
క్వినాల్ఫాస్ 2.0 మి.లీ. లేదా థయోడికార్బ్ 1.5 గ్రా లేదా ప్రొఫెనోఫాస్ 2 మి.లీ. లేదా క్లోరిపైరిఫాస్ 2.5 మి.లీ. ఒక లీటరు నీటికి కలిపి పిచికారి చేయాలి.
పంట కాలంలో ఒకటి లేదా రెడు సార్లు మాత్రమే సింథటిక్ పైరిత్రాయిడ్ మందులైన సైపర్ మైథిన్ 25% ఇ.సి. 1.0 మి.లీ లేదా లామ్డాపైహలోత్రిన్ 5.0% ఇ.సి. 1.0 మి.లీ. ఒక లీటరు నీటికి కలిపి పిచికారి చేయాలి.
సింథటిక్ పైరిత్రాయిడ్ మందులు ప్రత్తి పంటపై ఎక్కువ సార్లు పిచికారి చేసుకున్నట్లయితే రసం పీల్చే పురుగుల ఉధృతి పెరిగే అవకాశముంది.
పంట తీసిన తరువాత చేపట్టవలసిన యాజమాన్య పద్ధతులు
నీటివసతి ఉన్నపటికీ ప్రత్తిని ఏడు నెలలు మించి పొడిగించకుండా తీసివేయాలి. పంటకాలము పొడిగించుచ ద్వారా రాబోయే పంటలో పురుగు ఉధృతి తొలిదశలోనే ఎక్కువయ్యే అవకాశముంది.
నీటివసతి ఉన్నచోట రెండో పంటలుగా ఇతర ఆరుతడి పంటల్ని సాగుచేసుకోవడం వలన పంట మార్పిడి జరగడమే కాకుండా ప్రత్తిలో వచ్చే ఆదాయం కన్నా ఎక్కువ ఆధాయం పొందవచ్చు.
పంట తీసిన తరువాత చేనులో గొర్రెలు, మేకలు, పశువులను తోలి మేపాలి.
ప్రత్తి మొళ్ళను ష్రెడ్డరుతో గాని, రోటావేటరుతో గాని భూమిలో కలియదున్నాలి.
ప్రతి మొళ్లను ఇళ్ళ వద్ద పొయ్యిలో వాడేందుకు నిల్వ చేయకూడదు.
ప్రత్తి తీసిన తరువాత ఎండిన మొళ్ళను, విచ్చుకొని కాయలను పీకివేసి తగులబెట్టి ఆ తరువాత భూమిలో కలియదున్నుట ద్వారా"
